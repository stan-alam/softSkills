## notes on 'the Person you mean to be'

```text
An inspiring guide from Dolly Chugh, an award-winning social psychologist at the
New York University Stern School of Business, on how to confront difficult issues
including sexism, racism, inequality, and injustice so that you can make the world
(and yourself) better.

Many of us believe in equality, diversity, and inclusion. But how do we stand up
for those values in our turbulent world? The Person You Mean to Be is the smart,
“semi-bold” person’s guide to fighting for what you believe in.

Dolly reveals the surprising causes of inequality, grounded in the
“psychology of good people”. Using her research findings in unconscious bias as well
as work across psychology, sociology, economics, political science, and other
disciplines, she offers practical tools to respectfully and effectively talk
politics with family, to be a better colleague to people who don’t look like
you, and to avoid being a well-intentioned barrier to equality. Being the
person we mean to be starts with a look at ourselves.

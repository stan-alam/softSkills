## notes on Principles

```text
In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his
two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more
money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth
most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine.
Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential
people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles
that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes
as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful
relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not
anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long
Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.

In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable
career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be
systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical
lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical
transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals
and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams.
He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy
to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their
strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to
make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for
organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward
approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what
they’re seeking to achieve.

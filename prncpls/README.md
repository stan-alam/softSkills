## notes on Principles

```text
In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his
two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more
money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth
most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine.
Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential
people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles
that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes
as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful
relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not
anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long
Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.

In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable
career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be
systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical
lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical
transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals
and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams.
He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy
to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their
strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to
make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for
organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward
approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what
they’re seeking to achieve.

**understand that people are wired differently**
```text
Because of the different ways that our brains are wired, we all experience reality in
different ways and any single way is essentially distorted. This is something that we
need to acknowledge and deal with. So if you want to know what is true and what to do
about it, you must understand your own brain.

That insight led me to talk with many psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists,
personality testers, and other believable people in the field, and it led me to read many
books. I discovered that though it is obvious to all of us that we are born with different
strengths and weaknesses in areas such as common sense, creativity, memory, synthesis,
attention to detail, and so forth, examining these differences objectively makes even most
scientists uncomfortable. But that doesn’t make it any less necessary, so I pushed forward
with these explorations over several decades.

As a result, I have learned a lot that helped me and that I believe can help you. In fact,
I attribute as much of my success to what I’ve learned about the brain as I do to my
understanding of economics and investing. In this next batch of principles, I will share
some of the amazing things I’ve learned.

**Know that the most constant struggle is between Feeling and Thinking**
```text
There are no greater battles than those between our feelings (most importantly controlled by
our amygdala, which operates subconsciously) and our rational thinking (most importantly
controlled by our prefrontal cortex, which operates consciously). If you understand how those
battles occur you will understand why it is so important to reconcile what you get from your
subconscious with what you get from your conscious mind.

That damned amygdala, which is a little almond-shaped structure that lies deeply embedded in
the cerebrum, is one of the most powerful parts of your brain. It controls your behavior, even
though you’re not conscious of it. How does it work? When something upsets us—and that something
could be a sound, a sight, or just a gut feeling—the amygdala sends notice to our bodies to prepare
to fight or flee: the heartbeat speeds up, the blood pressure rises, and breathing quickens.
During an argument, you’ll often notice a physical response similar to how you react to fear
(for instance, rapid heartbeats and tensing muscles). Recognizing that, your conscious mind
(which resides in the prefrontal cortex) can refuse to obey its instructions. Typically, these
amygdala hijackings come on fast and dissipate quickly, except in rare cases, such as when a
person develops post-traumatic stress disorder from a particularly horrible event or series of
events. Knowing how these hijackings work, you know that if you allow yourself to react
spontaneously, you will be prone to overreact. You can also comfort yourself with the knowledge
that whatever psychological pain you are experiencing will go away before very long.

**Treasure honorable people who are capable and will treat you well even when you're not looking**
They are rare. Such relationships take time to build and can only be built if you treat such people well.

**'WORK PRINCIPLE OF THE DAY GREAT CULTURES BRING PROBLEMS AND DISAGREEMENTS TO THE SURFACE AND SOLVE THEM WELL, AND THEY LOVE IMAGINING AND BUILDING GREAT THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN BUILT BEFORE'**

Doing that sustains their evolution.

In the case of Bridgewater, we do that by having an idea meritocracy that strives for meaningful
work and meaningful relationships through radical truth and radical transparency. By meaningful
work, I mean work that people are excited to get their heads into, and by meaningful
relationships I mean those in which there is genuine caring for each other (like an
  extended family). I find that these reinforce each other and that being radically
  truthful and radically transparent with each other makes both the work and the
  relationships go better.

**Logic, Reason, And Common Sense** are your best tools for synthesizing reality and understanding what to do about it.

Be wary of relying on anything else. Unfortunately, numerous tests by psychologists show that the majority of people follow the lower-level path most of the time, which leads to inferior decisions without their realizing it. As Carl Jung put it, “Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate.” It’s even more important that decision making be evidence-based and logical when groups of people are working together. If it’s not, the process will inevitably be dominated by the most powerful rather than the most insightful participants, which is not only unfair but suboptimal. Successful organizations have cultures in which evidence-based decision making is the norm rather than the exception.

## notes on Principles

```text
In 1975, Ray Dalio founded an investment firm, Bridgewater Associates, out of his
two-bedroom apartment in New York City. Forty years later, Bridgewater has made more
money for its clients than any other hedge fund in history and grown into the fifth
most important private company in the United States, according to Fortune magazine.
Dalio himself has been named to Time magazine’s list of the 100 most influential
people in the world. Along the way, Dalio discovered a set of unique principles
that have led to Bridgewater’s exceptionally effective culture, which he describes
as “an idea meritocracy that strives to achieve meaningful work and meaningful
relationships through radical transparency.” It is these principles, and not
anything special about Dalio—who grew up an ordinary kid in a middle-class Long
Island neighborhood—that he believes are the reason behind his success.

In Principles, Dalio shares what he’s learned over the course of his remarkable
career. He argues that life, management, economics, and investing can all be
systemized into rules and understood like machines. The book’s hundreds of practical
lessons, which are built around his cornerstones of “radical truth” and “radical
transparency,” include Dalio laying out the most effective ways for individuals
and organizations to make decisions, approach challenges, and build strong teams.
He also describes the innovative tools the firm uses to bring an idea meritocracy
to life, such as creating “baseball cards” for all employees that distill their
strengths and weaknesses, and employing computerized decision-making systems to
make believability-weighted decisions. While the book brims with novel ideas for
organizations and institutions, Principles also offers a clear, straightforward
approach to decision-making that Dalio believes anyone can apply, no matter what
they’re seeking to achieve.

**understand that people are wired differently**
```text
Because of the different ways that our brains are wired, we all experience reality in
different ways and any single way is essentially distorted. This is something that we
need to acknowledge and deal with. So if you want to know what is true and what to do
about it, you must understand your own brain.

That insight led me to talk with many psychologists, psychiatrists, neuroscientists,
personality testers, and other believable people in the field, and it led me to read many
books. I discovered that though it is obvious to all of us that we are born with different
strengths and weaknesses in areas such as common sense, creativity, memory, synthesis,
attention to detail, and so forth, examining these differences objectively makes even most
scientists uncomfortable. But that doesn’t make it any less necessary, so I pushed forward
with these explorations over several decades.

As a result, I have learned a lot that helped me and that I believe can help you. In fact,
I attribute as much of my success to what I’ve learned about the brain as I do to my
understanding of economics and investing. In this next batch of principles, I will share
some of the amazing things I’ve learned.

## Notes on Taming Toxic People

```text
Bestselling author David Gillespie turns his attention to a phenomenon that
damages businesses, seeds mental disease and discomfort and can bring
civilizations to the brink of implosion â€“ the psychopath.

Psychopaths are often thought of as killers and criminals, but actually five
to ten per cent of people are probably psychopathic without ever indulging
in a single criminal act. These everyday psychopaths may be charming in the
early stages of relationships or employment but, Gillespie argues, their
presence in your life is at best disruptive, and at worst highly dangerous:
they will leave you feeling cheated and humiliated, dominating and
manipulating you to the point where you question your sanity. Worse,
he cautions, at a societal level their tendency to gravitate towards
positions of power can be disastrous.

Taming Toxic People is a practical guide to restraining that
difficult person in your life, be it your boss, your spouse or a
parent. But it is also a serious and meticulously researched
warning: if we value a free and well-functioning society, we
need to rebuild the sense of community that has historically
kept the everyday psychopath in check, and we must understand
 and act to manage the psychopathic behavior in our midst.

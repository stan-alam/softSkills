## notes on Technical communication

```text
Instructors know that Mike Markel’s Technical Communication will prepare their
students for any workplace writing situation. No other text offers such a
comprehensive introduction to the field while still delivering practical, effective
support for students at every level. The eleventh edition has been thoroughly revised
to reframe the work of technical communicators in the context of today’s highly
collaborative, rapidly evolving digital practices. Fresh, social-media driven sample
documents and coverage of the latest tools and technologies ensure that students work
with the kinds of processes and products they’ll encounter on the job.
Mike Markel is director of technical communication at Boise State University, where he
teaches both undergraduate and graduate courses. The former editor of IEEE
Transactions on Professional Communication, he is the author of numerous
articles and six books about technical communication, including Ethics and
Technical Communication: A Critique and Synthesis.

## notes for Hello World

```text
If you were accused of a crime, who would you rather decide your sentence―a mathematically
consistent algorithm incapable of empathy or a compassionate human judge prone to bias and
error? What if you want to buy a driverless car and must choose between one programmed to
save as many lives as possible and another that prioritizes the lives of its own passengers?
And would you agree to share your family’s full medical history if you were told that it
would help researchers find a cure for cancer?

These are just some of the dilemmas that we are beginning to face as we approach the age
of the algorithm, when it feels as if the machines reign supreme. Already, these lines of code
are telling us what to watch, where to go, whom to date, and even whom to send to jail. But as
we rely on algorithms to automate big, important decisions―in crime, justice, healthcare,
transportation, and money―they raise questions about what we want our world to look like.
What matters most: Helping doctors with diagnosis or preserving privacy? Protecting victims of
crime or preventing innocent people being falsely accused?

Hello World takes us on a tour through the good, the bad, and the downright ugly of the
algorithms that surround us on a daily basis. Mathematician Hannah Fry reveals their inner
workings, showing us how algorithms are written and implemented, and demonstrates the
ways in which human bias can literally be written into the code. By weaving in relatable,
real world stories with accessible explanations of the underlying mathematics that power
algorithms, Hello World helps us to determine their power, expose their limitations, and
examine whether they really are improvement on the human systems they replace.

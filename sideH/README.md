## notes on 'Side Hustle'

```text
To some, the idea of quitting their day job to start a business is exhilarating.
For others, it’s terrifying. After all, a job that produces a steady paycheck can
be difficult to give up.

But in a time when businesses have so little loyalty to employees that the very notion of
“job security” has become a punchline, wouldn’t it be great to have an additional source of
income to fall back on? And wouldn’t it be great to make that happen without
leaving your day job?

Enter the Side Hustle. Based on detailed information from hundreds of case studies,
Chris Guillebeau provides a step-by-step guide that anyone can use to create and
launch a profitable project in less than a month. Designed for the busy and
impatient, this plan will have you generating income immediately, without the
risk of throwing yourself head first into the world of entrepreneurship.

Whether you just want to make some extra money, or start something that may
end up replacing your day job entirely, the side hustle is the new job security.
When you generate income from multiple sources, it gives you options, and in
today’s world, options aren’t just nice to have: they’re essential.

You don’t need entrepreneurial experience to launch a profitable side hustle.
You don’t need a business degree, know how to code, or be an expert marketer.
And you certainly don’t need employees or investors. With this book as your guide,
anyone can learn to build a fast track to freedom.

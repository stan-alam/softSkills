## notes on 'Being fierce'

```text
In BE FIERCE, Gretchen shares her own experiences, as well as powerful and moving stories
from women in many different careers and fields who decided they too weren’t ready to
shut up and sit down. Gretchen became a voice for the voiceless.
In this revealing and timely book, Gretchen shares her views on what women can do to
empower and protect themselves in the workplace or on a college campus, what to say
when someone makes suggestive remarks, how an employer’s Human Resources department
may not always be your friend, and how forced arbitration clauses in work contracts
often serve to protect companies rather than employees. Her groundbreaking message
encourages women to stand up and speak up in every aspect of their lives.
Gretchen also discusses why this fight will require both women and men working
together to ensure that our daughters and sons will have a brighter future.

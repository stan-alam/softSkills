## notes on Are You OK

```text
Everyone struggles with mental health issues from time to time, but the greatest
level of misunderstanding comes from knowing the difference between mental health
and mental illness, figuring out whether we need professional help and, if so, how
to find it. Are u ok? walks readers through the most commonly asked questions about
mental health and the process of getting help. From finding the best therapist to
navigating harmful and toxic relationships and everything in between, licensed family
therapist and YouTube sensation Kati Morton clarifies and de-stigmatizes the struggles
so many of us go through, and encourages readers to reach out for help. What are the
red flags of a mental health issue? How do you go about making a first therapy
appointment? How do you know if your therapist is a good fit for you? What are
the best ways of talking about mental health with your family, friends and
colleagues? There are so many questions and concerns, and in the down-to-earth,
friendly tone that makes Kati Morton so popular on YouTube, Are u ok? informs
and reminds us that we can get through the difficult times and we are never alone.

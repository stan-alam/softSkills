## Be Fearless

```text

This book is a call to action for those seeking to live extraordinary lives and
bring about transformational change.

When National Geographic Chairman Jean Case set out to investigate the core qualities
of great change makers, past and present, from inventors to revolutionaries, she found
five surprising traits all had in common. They weren’t wealth, privilege, or even genius.
It was that all of these exceptional men and women chose to make a “big bet,” take bold
risks, learn from their failures, reach beyond their bubbles, and let urgency conquer fear.

Throughout Be Fearless, Jean vividly illustrates these principles through storytelling—from
her own transformational life experiences, to Jane Goodall’s remarkable breakthroughs in
understanding and protecting chimpanzees, to celebrity chef José Andrés’ decision to be a
“first responder” and take his kitchen to the sites of devastating hurricanes to feed the hungry,
to Bryan Stevenson’s ambitious efforts to end incarceration inequities, and more. She shares new
insights to stories you might think you know—like AirBnB’s tale of starting from scratch to
transform the hospitality industry, to John F. Kennedy’s history-making moonshot—and gems f
rom changemakers you’ve never heard of.

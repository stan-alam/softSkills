## notes on Dark Horse

```text
For generations, we’ve been stuck with a cookie-cutter mold for success that
requires us to be the same as everyone else, only better. This “standard formula”
works for some people but leaves most of us feeling disengaged and frustrated.
As much as we might dislike the standard formula, it seems like there’s no other
practical path to financial security and a fulfilling life. But what if there is?

In the Dark Horse Project at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, bestselling
author and acclaimed thought leader Todd Rose and neuroscientist Ogi Ogas studied
women and men who achieved impressive success even though nobody saw them coming.
Dark horses blaze their own trail to a life of happiness and prosperity. Yet what
is so remarkable is that hidden inside their seemingly one-of-a-kind journeys are
practical principles for achieving success that work for anyone, no matter who you
are or what you hope to achieve. This mold-breaking approach doesn’t depend on you
SAT scores, who you know, or how much money you have. The secret is a mindset that
can be expressed in plain English: Harness your individuality in the pursuit of
fulfillment to achieve excellence.

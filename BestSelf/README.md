## Notes on 'Best Self'

```text
How would you answer those questions? Think about your daily life. Are you thriving,
or going through the motions? Are your days full of work, relationships and activities
that are true to your authentic self, or do you feel trapped on a treadmill of responsibility?
If you dream of a better life, now is the time to turn your dream into reality. And the tools
you need are within your grasp, to design a life that is fulfilling on the deepest levels.
Best Self will show you how.

Mike Bayer, known to the thousands of clients whose lives he has changed as Coach Mike,
has helped everyone from pop stars to business executives to people just like you discover
the freedom to be their best selves. By asking them and leading them to ask themselves a
series of important but tough questions—such as “What are your core values?”  “Do you go to
bed each day more knowledgeable than when you woke up?” and “Am I neglecting some aspect of
my physical health out of fear or denial?”—he helps them see what their Best Selves and Anti-
Selves really look like. As a mental health specialist, a personal development coach, and an
all-around change agent, Mike has seen the amazing ways in which lives can improve with honesty
and clarity.  He understands our struggles intimately, because he’s faced—and overcome—his own.
And he knows that change is possible.

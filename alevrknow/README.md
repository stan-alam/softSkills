## notes on 'All you can ever know'
```text
Nicole Chung was born severely premature, placed for adoption by her Korean parents,
and raised by a white family in a sheltered Oregon town. From childhood,
she heard the story of her adoption as a comforting, prepackaged myth. She
believed that her biological parents had made the ultimate sacrifice in the
hope of giving her a better life, that forever feeling slightly out of place
was her fate as a transracial adoptee. But as Nicole grew up—facing prejudice
her adoptive family couldn’t see, finding her identity as an Asian American and
as a writer, becoming ever more curious about where she came from—she wondered
if the story she’d been told was the whole truth.

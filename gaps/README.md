## Notes on Filling Execution Gaps: How Executives and Project Managers Turn
## Corporate Strategy into Successful Projects

“I expected good, but this is great.” -Janet Pirus Phelps, Former CFO Papa Murphy’s Pizza
Gaps . . . holes in your organization where tasks fall and failure breeds. They inhibit your ability
to implement strategic plans, lead people, and run successful projects. Daily, executives, middle managers,
and project managers wrestle with “the big six”:

    Absence of common understanding

    Disengaged executive sponsors

    Misalignment with goals

    Poor change management

    Ineffective governance

    Lackluster leadership

Ignoring any of these gaps will hex any strategy or project. They regularly destroy
hundreds of companies’ ability to turn their corporate vision into business value–taking
careers with them.
Filling Execution Gaps addresses the sources of these gaps, and how to fill them. Without
any one of these important functions, projects fail. Without change management, adoption suffers.
Without common understanding, there is confusion. Without goals, business units, and capabilities
aligned, execution falters. Without executive sponsorship, decisions languish. Too little governance
allows bad things to happen, while too much governance creates overburdening bureaucracy. Without
leadership at all levels of the organization, people are directionless.
Using decades of experience, years of research, and interviews with hundreds of business leaders,
Todd Williams illustrates how to fill these gaps, meet corporate goals, and increase value.

## notes on 'Successful Mindset'

```text
World-renowned Stanford University psychologist Carol Dweck, in decades of research
on achievement and success, has discovered a truly groundbreaking idea—the power of our mindset.
Dweck explains why it’s not just our abilities and talent that bring us success—but
whether we approach them with a fixed or growth mindset. She makes clear why praising
intelligence and ability doesn’t foster self-esteem and lead to accomplishment, but may
actually jeopardize success. With the right mindset, we can motivate our kids and help
them to raise their grades, as well as reach our own goals—personal and professional.
Dweck reveals what all great parents, teachers, CEOs, and athletes already know: how a
simple idea about the brain can create a love of learning and a resilience that is the
basis of great accomplishment in every area.
Mindset is “an established set of attitudes held by someone,” says the Oxford American
Dictionary. It turns out, however, that a set of attitudes needn’t be so set, according to
Dweck, professor of psychology at Stanford. Dweck proposes that everyone has either a fixed
mindset or a growth mindset. A fixed mindset is one in which you view your talents and
abilities as… well, fixed. In other words, you are who you are, your intelligence and
talents are fixed, and your fate is to go through life avoiding challenge and failure.
A growth mindset, on the other hand, is one in which you see yourself as fluid, a work
in progress. Your fate is one of growth and opportunity. Which mindset do you possess?
Dweck provides a checklist to assess yourself and shows how a particular mindset can
affect all areas of your life, from business to sports and love. The good news, says
Dweck, is that mindsets are not set: at any time, you can learn to use a growth mindset
to achieve success and happiness. This is a serious, practical book. Dweck’s overall
assertion that rigid thinking benefits no one, least of all yourself, and that a change of
mind is always possible, is welcome.
“Everyone should read this book.”—Chip and Dan Heath, authors of Switch and Made to Stick
“Will prove to be one of the most influential books ever about motivation.”—Po
Bronson, author of NurtureShock

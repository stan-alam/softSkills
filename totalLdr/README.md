In this national bestseller, Stew Friedman gives you the tools you need to achieve

and self. Friedman, celebrated professor and founding director of the Wharton School’s
Leadership Program and its Work/Life Integration Project, explains how three simple yet
potent principles—be real, be whole, and be innovative—can help you, no matter what
your age or what you do for work, become a better leader and have a richer life.

In this engaging adaptation of his hands-on Wharton course, he offers step-by-step
instruction to help you create positive, sustainable change in your world. This proven,
programmatic method teaches you how to produce stronger results at work, find clearer purpose,
feel less stressed, strengthen connections with the people who matter most to you, contribute
further to important causes, and gain greater support for your vision of your future.
If you’re ready to learn to lead in all parts of your life—this is the book for you.

Also look for Stew Friedman’s book, Leading the Life You Want, which builds on Total
Leadership by profiling well-known leaders—from Bruce Springsteen to Michelle Obama—who
exemplify its principles and demonstrate how success in your work is accomplished not
at the expense of the rest of your life, but as the result of meaningful attachments to all its parts.

“In a world of work-life trade-offs, Stew Friedman offers what most think impossible,
a field-tested program that gives you not only what you want in business, but also what
you want in life. Brilliant!”
—Timothy Ferris, author, The 4-Hour Workweek, #1 New York Times bestseller

“The best leaders are those who stay connected—to their communities, to the people they love,
to themselves. In Stew Friedman’s Total Leadership, you’ll learn simple, powerful new ways
to make these connections happen and enjoy the rich rewards that inevitably follow.”
—Keith Ferrazzi, CEO, Ferrazzi Greenlight, and coauthor, Never Eat Alone

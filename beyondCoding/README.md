## Notes on Beyond Coding

Beyond Coding: How Children Learn Human Values through Programming.


Why children should be taught coding not as a technical skill but as a new literacy—a way to express themselves and engage with the world.

Today, schools are introducing STEM education and robotics to children in ever-lower grades. 
In Beyond Coding, Marina Umaschi Bers lays out a pedagogical roadmap for teaching code that 
encompasses the cultivation of character along with technical knowledge and skills. Presenting 
code as a universal language, she shows how children discover new ways of thinking, relating, 
and behaving through creative coding activities. Today’s children will undoubtedly have the 
technical knowledge to change the world. But cultivating strength of character, socioeconomic 
maturity, and a moral compass alongside that knowledge, says Bers, is crucial.

Bers, a leading proponent of teaching computational thinking and coding as early as preschool 
and kindergarten, presents examples of children and teachers using the Scratch Jr. and Kibo robotics 
platforms to make explicit some of the positive values implicit in the process of learning computer science. 
If we are to do right by our children, our approach to coding must incorporate the elements of a moral education: 
the use of narrative to explore identity and values, the development of logical thinking to think 
critically and solve technical and ethical problems, and experiences in the community to enable personal 
relationships. Through learning the language of programming, says Bers, it is possible for diverse cultural and 
religious groups to find points of connection, put assumptions and stereotypes behind them, 
and work together toward a common goal.

## notes on Bitwise

```text
Bitwise is a wondrous ode to the computer lan­guages and codes that captured
technologist David Auerbach’s imagination. With a philoso­pher’s sense of inquiry,
Auerbach recounts his childhood spent drawing ferns with the pro­gramming language
Logo on the Apple IIe, his adventures in early text-based video games, his education
as an engineer, and his contribu­tions to instant messaging technology devel­oped for
Microsoft and the servers powering Google’s data stores. A lifelong student of the
systems that shape our lives—from the psy­chiatric taxonomy of the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual to how Facebook tracks and profiles its users—Auerbach reflects
on how he has experienced the algorithms that taxonomize human speech, knowledge,
and behavior and that compel us to do the same.

Into this exquisitely crafted, wide-ranging memoir of a life spent with code,
Auerbach has woven an eye-opening and searing examina­tion of the inescapable
ways in which algo­rithms have both standardized and coarsened our lives. As we
engineer ever more intricate technology to translate our experiences and narrow
the gap that divides us from the ma­chine, Auerbach argues, we willingly erase
our nuances and our idiosyncrasies—precisely the things that make us human.

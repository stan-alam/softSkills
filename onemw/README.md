## notes on 'One minute workout.'

```text
A decade ago, Martin Gibala was a young researcher in the field of exercise physiology—with
little time to exercise. That critical point in his career launched a passion for high-intensity
interval training (HIIT), allowing him to stay in shape with just a few minutes of hard effort.
It also prompted Gibala to conduct experiments that helped launch the exploding science of ultralow-volume
exercise. Now that he’s the worldwide guru of the science of time-efficient workouts, Gibala’s first book
answers the ultimate question: How low can you go?

Gibala’s fascinating quest for the answer makes exercise experts of us all. His work demonstrates that very
short, intense bursts of exercise may be the most potent form of workout available. Gibala busts myths
(“it’s only for really fit people”), explains astonishing science (“intensity trumps duration”), lays out
time-saving life hacks (“exercise snacking”), and describes the fascinating health-promoting value of HIIT
(for preventing and reversing disease). Gibala’s latest study found that sedentary people derived the fitness
benefits of 150 minutes of traditional endurance training with an interval protocol that involved 80 percent
less time and just three minutes of hard exercise per week.

Including the eight best basic interval workouts as well as four microworkouts customized for individual needs
and preferences (you may not quite want to go all out every time), The One-Minute Workout solves the number-one
reason we don’t exercise: lack of time. Because everyone has one minute.

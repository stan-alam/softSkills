## notes on 'How the Internet Happened.'

```text
The internet was never intended for you, opines Brian McCullough in this lively
narrative of an era that utterly transformed everything we thought we knew about
technology. In How the Internet Happened, he chronicles the whole fascinating
story for the first time, beginning in a dusty Illinois basement in 1993, when a
group of college kids set off a once-in-an-epoch revolution with what would
become the first “dotcom.”

Depicting the lives of now-famous innovators like Netscape’s Marc Andreessen and
Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, McCullough also reveals surprising quirks and unknown
tales as he tracks both the technology and the culture around the internet’s rise.
Cinematic in detail and unprecedented in scope, the result both enlightens and
informs as it draws back the curtain on the new rhythm of disruption and innovation
the internet fostered, and helps to redefine an era that changed every part of our lives.

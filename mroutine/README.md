## notes on 'Morning Routine'

```text
Marie Kondo performs a quick tidying ritual to quiet her mind before leaving the house.
The president of Pixar and Walt Disney Animation Studios, Ed Catmull, mixes three shots of
espresso with three scoops of cocoa powder and two sweeteners. Fitness expert Jillian
Michaels doesn’t set an alarm, because her five-year-old jolts her from sleep by jumping into bed for a cuddle every morning.

Part instruction manual, part someone else’s diary, the authors of My Morning Routine interviewed  
sixty-four of today’s most successful people, including  three-time Olympic gold medalist Rebecca
Soni, Twitter cofounder Biz Stone, and General Stanley McChrystal–and offer advice on creating a
routine of your own.

Some routines are all about early morning exercise and spartan living; others are more leisurely
and self-indulgent. What they have in common is they don’t feel like a chore. Once you land on
the right routine, you’ll look forward to waking up.

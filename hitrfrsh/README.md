## notes on 'Hit Refresh'

```text
Hit Refresh is about individual change, about the transformation happening
inside of Microsoft and the technology that will soon impact all of our
lives—the arrival of the most exciting and disruptive wave of technology
humankind has experienced: artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and
quantum computing. It’s about how people, organizations, and societies
can and must transform and “hit refresh” in their persistent quest for new
energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal.

Microsoft’s CEO tells the inside story of the company’s continuing
transformation, tracing his own personal journey from a childhood in
India to leading some of the most significant technological changes in the
digital era. Satya Nadella explores a fascinating childhood before immigrating
to the U.S. and how he learned to lead along the way. He then shares his
 meditations as a sitting CEO—one who is mostly unknown following the brainy
 Bill Gates and energetic Steve Ballmer. He tells the inside story of how a
 company rediscovered its soul—transforming everything from culture to their
 fiercely competitive landscape and industry partnerships. As much a humanist
 as engineer and executive, Nadella concludes with his vision for the coming
 wave of technology and by exploring the potential impact to society and
 delivering call to action for world leaders.

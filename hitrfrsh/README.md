## notes on 'Hit Refresh'

```text
Hit Refresh is about individual change, about the transformation happening
inside of Microsoft and the technology that will soon impact all of our
lives—the arrival of the most exciting and disruptive wave of technology
humankind has experienced: artificial intelligence, mixed reality, and
quantum computing. It’s about how people, organizations, and societies
can and must transform and “hit refresh” in their persistent quest for new
energy, new ideas, and continued relevance and renewal.

Microsoft’s CEO tells the inside story of the company’s continuing
transformation, tracing his own personal journey from a childhood in
India to leading some of the most significant technological changes in the
digital era. Satya Nadella explores a fascinating childhood before immigrating
to the U.S. and how he learned to lead along the way. He then shares his
 meditations as a sitting CEO—one who is mostly unknown following the brainy
 Bill Gates and energetic Steve Ballmer. He tells the inside story of how a
 company rediscovered its soul—transforming everything from culture to their
 fiercely competitive landscape and industry partnerships. As much a humanist
 as engineer and executive, Nadella concludes with his vision for the coming
 wave of technology and by exploring the potential impact to society and
 delivering call to action for world leaders.

 "But it is impossible to be an empathetic leader sitting in an office behind a computer screen all day. An empathetic leader needs to be out in the world, meeting people where they live and seeing how the technology we create affects their daily activities. So many people around the world today depend on mobile and cloud technologies without knowing it. Hospitals, schools, businesses, and researchers rely on what’s referred to as the “public cloud”—an array of large-scale, privacy-protected computers and data services accessible over a public network. Cloud computing makes it possible to analyze vast quantities of data to produce specific insights and intelligence, converting guesswork and speculation into predictive power."

 "My son’s condition requires that I draw daily upon the very same passion for ideas and empathy that I learned from my parents. And I do this both at home and at work. Whether I am meeting with people in Latin America, the Middle East, or one of the inner cities of America, I am always searching to understand people’s thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Being an empathetic father, and bringing that desire to discover what is at the core, the soul, makes me a better leader."

"hitting refresh may sound quaint, but still when it’s done right, when people and cultures re-create and refresh, a renaissance can be the result. Sports franchises do it. Apple did it. Detroit is doing it. One day ascending companies like Facebook will stop growing, and they will have to do it too."

"I needed to get some things square in my own mind—and, ultimately, in the minds of everyone who works at Microsoft. Why does Microsoft exist? And why do I exist in this new role? These are questions everyone in every organization should ask themselves. I worried that failing to ask these questions, and truly answer them, risked perpetuating earlier mistakes and, worse, not being honest."

"February day in 2014 when Microsoft’s board of directors announced that I would become CEO, I put the company’s culture at the top of our agenda. I said that we needed to rediscover the soul of Microsoft, our reason for being."

"I’ll take up the argument that a Fourth Industrial Revolution lies ahead, one in which machine intelligence will rival that of humans. We’ll explore some heady questions. What will the role of humans become? Will inequality resolve or worsen? How can governments help? What is the role of multinational corporations and their leaders?"

"The mystical Austrian poet Rainer Maria Rilke once wrote that “the future enters into us, in order to transform itself in us, long before it happens.” As much as elegant computer code for machines, existential poetry can illuminate and instruct us. Speaking to us from another century, Rilke is saying that what lies ahead is very much within us, determined by the course each of us takes today."

"Ironically, it was a lack of empathy that nearly cost me the chance to join Microsoft as a young man some twenty years before. Looking back to my own interview process decades ago,"

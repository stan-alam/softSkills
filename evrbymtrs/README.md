## notes on Everybody matters

```text
Starting in 1997, Bob Chapman and Barry-Wehmiller have pioneered a dramatically
different approach to leadership that creates off-the-charts morale, loyalty, creativity,
and business performance. The company utterly rejects the idea that employees are simply
functions, to be moved around, “managed” with carrots and sticks, or discarded at will.
Instead, Barry-Wehmiller manifests the reality that every single person matters, just like
in a family. That’s not a cliché on a mission statement; it’s the bedrock of the company’s success.
During tough times a family pulls together, makes sacrifices together, and endures short-term pain
together. If a parent loses his or her job, a family doesn’t lay off one of the kids. That’s the
approach Barry-Wehmiller took when the Great Recession caused revenue to plunge for more than a
year. Instead of mass layoffs, they found creative and caring ways to cut costs, such as asking
team members to take a month of unpaid leave. As a result, Barry-Wehmiller emerged from the
downturn with higher employee morale than ever before.
It’s natural to be skeptical when you first hear about this approach. Every time Barry-Wehmiller
acquires a company that relied on traditional management practices, the new team members are
skeptical too. But they soon learn what it’s like to work at an exceptional workplace where the
goal is for everyone to feel trusted and cared for—and where it’s expected that they will justify
that trust by caring for each other and putting the common good first.
“Is it possible to run a successful business without treating people like numbers? Can a corporate
culture of mistrust and insecurity be transformed into one of caring and fulfillment? Everybody
Matters answers these questions with an enthusiastic ‘Yes!’ If you’re ready for a new way of doing
business, this is the book for you.”

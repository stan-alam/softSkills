## Workspace notes on 'Educated'

```text
An unforgettable memoir about a young girl who, kept out of school, leaves her
survivalist family and goes on to earn a PhD from Cambridge University

“Beautiful and propulsive . . . Despite the singularity of [Tara Westover’s]
childhood, the questions her book poses are universal: How much of ourselves
should we give to those we love? And how much must we betray them to grow up?”—Vogue

Born to survivalists in the mountains of Idaho, Tara Westover was seventeen the
first time she set foot in a classroom. Her family was so isolated from mainstream
society that there was no one to ensure the children received an education and no
one to intervene when one of Tara’s older brothers became violent. When another
brother got himself into college, Tara decided to try a new kind of life.
Her quest for knowledge transformed her, taking her over oceans and across
continents, to Harvard and to Cambridge University. Only then would she wonder
if she’d traveled too far if there was still a way home.

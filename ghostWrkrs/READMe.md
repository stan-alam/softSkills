Mary Gray and Siddharth Suri’s new book, Ghost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass, examines the invisible human workforce that powers the web. The book explores the lives of people who are paid to train artificial intelligence and, increasingly, serve as “humans in the loop” delivering on-demand information services.


From Ghost Work’s Introduction:


Whether it’s delivering a relevant newsfeed or carrying out a complicated texted-in pizza order, when the artificial intelligence (AI) trips up or can’t finish the job, thousands of businesses call on people to quietly complete the project. This new digital assembly line aggregates the collective input of distributed workers, ships pieces of projects rather than products, and operates across a host of economic sectors at all times of the day and night. In fact, the rise of this shadow workforce is part of a larger, more profound reorganization of employment itself. This yet-to-be-classified form of employment done on demand is neither inherently good nor bad. But left without definition and veiled from consumers who benefit from it, these jobs can easily slip into ghost work.


The workers that perform behind-the-scene tasks find assignments using on-demand labor platforms such as Mechanical Turk, LeadGenius, Amara, and Clickworker. According to Ghost Work, there are between 200,000 and 500,000 registered Mechanical Turk workers; and, 2000 to 5000 are usually working at any given moment. Work is paid by the piece and equates to low wages, and it does not offer benefits. However, these on-demand work platforms do provide an opportunity for many disadvantaged workers to earn income.


Joan – One of Many Ghost Workers


Joan works from the Houston home she shares with her 81-year-old mother. In 2012, Joan moved in to care for her mother after a knee surgery left her mom too frail to live on her own. A year later, Joan started picking up work online through MTurk  —  short for “Amazon Mechanical Turk,” a sprawling marketplace owned and operated by tech giant Amazon.com. Joan makes some of her best money doing “dollars for dick pics.” That’s how she describes labeling pictures flagged as “offensive” by social media users on platforms like Twitter and Match.com.


Companies can’t automatically process every piece of content users flag for review, so some of the harder-to-evaluate materials are routed to workers like Joan. On the surface, her task seems simple: click on pictures and assess their content. Is that an X-rated penis selfie that should be removed, or some innocuous G-rated body part? She is paid for each task she completes and decides when she walks away from her computer. Joan, with years of practice, now knows how to piece together an average ten-hour day that will bring in roughly $40 worth of such tasks.


There are currently no labor laws to govern this type of work. The authors show that over time, on-demand labor will displace full-time employment. And they outline how ghost workers, employers, and society at large can ensure that this new kind of work creates opportunity—rather than misery—for those who do it.

About the Authors


Mary L. Gray is a Fellow at Harvard University’s Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society and a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research. She maintains a faculty position in the School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering with affiliations in Anthropology, Gender Studies, and the Media School, at Indiana University. She studies how technology access, material conditions, and everyday uses of tech transform people’s lives. Professor Gray is a leading expert in the emerging field of AI and ethics, particularly research methods at the intersections of computer and social sciences.


Siddharth Suri is a Senior Researcher at Microsoft Research – AI. He is a computational social scientist whose work lies at the intersection of computer science, behavioral economics, crowdsourcing and the gig economy. His early work analyzed the relationship between network topology and human behavior. Since then he became one of the leaders in designing, building, and conducting “virtual lab” experiments using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. He used this methodology to study cooperation, honesty, group problem solving, and display advertising. Most recently, he has been studying the gig workers who power many modern apps, websites, and AI systems.

Hidden beneath the surface of the web, lost in our wrong-headed debates about AI, a new menace is looming. Anthropologist Mary L. Gray and computer scientist Siddharth Suri team up to unveil how services delivered by companies like Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Uber can only function smoothly thanks to the judgment and experience of a vast, invisible human labor force. These people doing “ghost work” make the internet seem smart. They perform high-tech piecework: flagging X-rated content, proofreading, designing engine parts, and much more. An estimated 8 percent of Americans have worked at least once in this “ghost economy,” and that number is growing. They usually earn less than legal minimums for traditional work, they have no health benefits, and they can be fired at any time for any reason, or none.
There are no labor laws to govern this kind of work, and these latter-day assembly lines draw in—and all too often overwork and underpay—a surprisingly diverse range of workers: harried young mothers, professionals forced into early retirement, recent grads who can’t get a toehold on the traditional employment ladder, and minorities shut out of the jobs they want. Gray and Suri also show how ghost workers, employers, and society at large can ensure that this new kind of work creates opportunity—rather than misery—for those who do it.

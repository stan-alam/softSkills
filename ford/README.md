## notes on Fordlandia: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford’s Forgotten Jungle City

```text
Proving that truth can indeed be stranger than fiction, Fordlandia is the story of Henry Ford’s
ill-advised attempt to transform raw Brazilian rainforest into homespun slices of Americana.
With sales of his Model-T booming, the automotive tycoon saw an opportunity to expand his
reach further by exploiting a downtrodden Brazilian rubber industry. His vision, the
laughably-named Amazonian outpost of Fordlandia, would become an enviable symbol of efficiency
and mark the Ford Motor Company as a player on the global stage. Or so he thought. With
thoughtful and meticulous research, author Greg Grandin explores the astounding oversights
(no botanists were consulted to confirm the colony’s agricultural viability) and painful
arrogance (little thought was paid to how native Brazilians would react to an American way of life)
that hamstrung the project from the start. Instead of ushering in a new era of commerce, Fordlandia
became a cautionary tale of a dream destroyed by hubris. –Dave Callanan

The stunning, never before told story of the quixotic attempt to recreate small-town America
in the heart of the Amazon

In 1927, Henry Ford, the richest man in the world, bought a tract of land twice the size of
Delaware in the Brazilian Amazon. His intention was to grow rubber, but the project rapidly
evolved into a more ambitious bid to export America itself, along with its golf courses,
ice-cream shops, bandstands, indoor plumbing, and Model Ts rolling down broad streets.

Fordlandia, as the settlement was called, quickly became the site of an epic clash. On one
side was the car magnate, lean, austere, the man who reduced industrial production to its
simplest motions; on the other, the Amazon, lush, extravagant, the most complex ecological
system on the planet. Ford’s early success in imposing time clocks and square dances on the
jungle soon collapsed, as indigenous workers, rejecting his midwestern Puritanism, turned the
place into a ribald tropical boomtown. Fordlandia’s eventual demise as a rubber plantation
foreshadowed the practices that today are laying waste to the rain forest.

More than a parable of one man’s arrogant attempt to force his will on the natural world,
Fordlandiadepicts a desperate quest to salvage the bygone America that the Ford factory system
did much to dispatch. As Greg Grandin shows in this gripping and mordantly observed history,
Ford’s great delusion was not that the Amazon could be tamed but that the forces of capitalism,
once released, might yet be contained.

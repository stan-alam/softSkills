Sitting can wreak havoc on your health, and not just in the form of minor aches and pains.
Recent studies show that too much sitting contributes to a host of diseases—from obesity and
diabetes to cancer and depression. The typical seated office worker suffers from more musculoskeletal
injuries than those workers who do daily manual labor. It turns out that sitting is as much an
occupational risk as is lifting heavy weights on the job. The facts are in: sitting literally shortens
your life. Your chair is your enemy, and it is murdering your body.

In this groundbreaking new book, Dr. Kelly Starrett—renowned physical therapist and author of the
New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller Becoming a Supple Leopard—unveils a detailed
battle plan for surviving our chair-centric society. Deskbound provides creative solutions for
reducing the amount of time you spend perched on your backside, as well as strategies for
transforming your desk into a dynamic, active workstation that can improve your life.

## notes on 'school of greatness'

```text
When a career-ending injury left elite athlete and professional football player
Lewis Howes out of work and living on his sister’s couch, he decided he needed to make a
change for the better. He started by reaching out to people he admired, searching for
mentors, and applying his past coaches’ advice from sports to life off the field. Lewis did
more than bounce back: He built a multimillion-dollar online business and is now a
sought-after business coach, speaker, and podcast host.

In The School of Greatness, Howes shares the essential tips and habits he gathered in interviewing
“the greats” on his wildly popular podcast of the same name. In discussion with people like Olympic
gold medalist Shawn Johnson and Pencils of Promise CEO Adam Braun, Howes figured out that greatness
is unearthed and cultivated from within. The masters of greatness are not successful because they
got lucky or are innately more talented, but because they applied specific habits and tools to
embrace and overcome adversity in their lives.

A framework for personal development, The School of Greatness gives you the tools, knowledge, and
actionable resources you need to reach your potential. Howes anchors each chapter with a specific
lesson he culled from his greatness “professors” and his own experiences to teach you how to
create a vision, develop hustle, and use dedication, mindfulness, joy, and love to reach goals.
His lessons and practical exercises prove that anyone is capable of achieving success and that
we can all strive for greatness in our everyday lives.

## notes on 'Fully Alive'

```text
Fully Alive tells the story of an astoundingly successful young entrepreneurâ€™s immersion
in Amazonian indigenous spirituality, its life-changing impact on him, and how he integrated
the lessons he learned to build a successful, socially responsible company, live a purposeful
life, and make a difference in the world.

Building a start-up is like being thrust into the middle of the Amazon rainforest: living every
day on the edge of your comfort zone, vulnerable to the unexpected challenges constantly being
thrown your way, and constantly shifting to meet daily demands and do everything and anything
you can to survive, let alone thrive.

Vulnerable, raw, and deeply transparent, Fully Alive reveals powerful tools and lessons that can
teach all of us how to grow toward and beyond our personal edges, no matter our circumstances.

Tyler Gage shares his spiritual adventures and the business savvy that helped him create RUNA, a
pioneering organization that weaves together the seemingly divergent worlds of Amazonian
traditions and modern business, demonstrating how we can dig deeper to bring greater meaning and
purpose to our personal and professional pursuits.

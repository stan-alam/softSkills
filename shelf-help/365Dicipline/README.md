## notes on 365 Days With Self-Discipline: 365 Life-Altering Thoughts on Self-Control, Mental Resilience, and Success 

Editorial Reviews
Review
"The entries are short and sweet and don't include a lot of "filler", which I greatly appreciate. I'm fine with an example here and there, but SO many OTHER self-help books will have a grain of goodness, and surround it with pages and pages of fluff. NOT so with this book (or any of Martin's books that I have read)! He is short and to the point, getting to the heart of the matter without a lot of unnecessary nonsense.

I highly recommend this book as it's already began helping me understand how to get out of my own comfort zones and start living a life of self-discipline." - Mary H., reader

"This book reminds me of the proverb "It takes a village to raise a child." We all need to learn self-disciple and what better way than to have a village of entrepreneurs, athletes, authors, researchers, performers, etc. Martin Meadows has built a village to help you and me in the path of self-disciple.. one day at a time. Excellent for meditation... for daily empowerment." - Meynardo, reader

"Super valuable resource from one of my favorite authors! Short, practical, daily lessons on self discipline to help anyone who wants to achieve more. This will be a part of my morning routine for the next year, and I know it will contribute greatly to a great year!" - J. Duncan Evanson, reader

"This is the book that I was looking for. In our busy lives, we don't have much time for anything. 365 days with Self-Discipline is perfect. You only need to read one page a day. Each day there is a quote and information to make you really think and start changing your habits." - Trish Shiloh, reader

"This book is fantastic for implementing DAILY self discipline. Everyday I am able to incorporate and learn such valuable insights. The layout is easy to follow. Absolutely LOVE IT!" - A. Grossi, reader
From the Author
I wrote 365 Days With Self-Discipline with the intention of creating a daily companion to help you embrace self-discipline in your everyday life.

As the author of several bestselling books about self-discipline and being a personal growth junkie myself, self-control is a topic close to my heart. I believe that if a person wants to reach their full potential, he or she can't avoid discomfort. Doing things that might not be entirely pleasant is key to achieving long-term objectives.

In the following pages, I'll share with you one thought for each day of a year that is devoted to the topic of self-discipline, mental toughness, success, or self-improvement in general. The thoughts come from some of the world's brightest minds: successful entrepreneurs, athletes, bestselling authors, researchers, performers, bloggers, and more.

Since the entries are brief and get straight to the heart of the matter, you'll be able to quickly find ongoing inspiration to continue working on your most important long-term goals and on becoming an ever better person.
About the Author
Martin Meadows is the pen name of an author who has dedicated his life to personal growth. He constantly reinvents himself by making drastic changes in his life.

Over the years, he has regularly fasted for over 40 hours, taught himself two foreign languages, lost over 30 pounds in 12 weeks, run several businesses in various industries, took ice-cold showers and baths, lived on a small tropical island in a foreign country for several months, and wrote a 400-page novel's worth of short stories in one month.

But self-torture is not his passion. Martin likes to test his boundaries to discover how far his comfort zone goes.

His findings (based both on his personal experience and on scientific studies) help him improve his life. If you're interested in pushing your limits and learning how to become the best version of yourself, you'll love Martin's works.

## notes on Team of Teams

THE OLD RULES NO LONGER APPLY . . .
When General Stanley McChrystal took command of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in 2004,
he quickly realized that conventional military tactics were failing. Al Qaeda in Iraq was a
decentralized network that could move quickly, strike ruthlessly, then seemingly vanish into the
local population. The allied forces had a huge advantage in numbers, equipment, and training—but
none of that seemed to matter.

TEACHING A LEVIATHAN TO IMPROVISE
It’s no secret that in any field, small teams have many ad­vantages—they can respond quickly,
communicate freely, and make decisions without layers of bureaucracy. But organizations taking on really
big challenges can’t fit in a garage. They need management practices that can scale to thousands of people.

General McChrystal led a hierarchical, highly disci­plined machine of thousands of men and women. But to
defeat Al Qaeda in Iraq, his Task Force would have to acquire the enemy’s speed and flexibility. Was there
a way to combine the power of the world’s mightiest military with the agility of the world’s most fearsome
terrorist network? If so, could the same principles apply in civilian organizations?

A NEW APPROACH FOR A NEW WORLD
McChrystal and his colleagues discarded a century of conventional wisdom and remade the Task Force, in
the midst of a grueling war, into something new: a network that combined extremely transparent communication
with decentralized decision-making authority. The walls between silos were torn down. Leaders looked at the
best practices of the smallest units and found ways to ex­tend them to thousands of people on three continents,
using technology to establish a oneness that would have been impossible even a decade earlier. The Task
Force became a “team of teams”—faster, flatter, more flex­ible—and beat back Al Qaeda.

BEYOND THE BATTLEFIELD
In this powerful book, McChrystal and his colleagues show how the challenges they faced in Iraq can be
rel­evant to countless businesses, nonprofits, and other or­ganizations. The world is changing faster than ever,
and the smartest response for those in charge is to give small groups the freedom to experiment while driving
every­one to share what they learn across the entire organiza­tion. As the authors argue through compelling
examples, the team of teams strategy has worked everywhere from hospital emergency rooms to NASA. It has the
potential to transform organizations large and small.

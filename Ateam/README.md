## notes on A-TEAM

```text
What’s the secret to having an engaged and productive team? It’s having a plan
for developing all employees–no matter where they are on their personal learning curves.

Better morale and higher performance happen through learning, argues Whitney Johnson.
In over twenty years of coaching, investing, and consulting, Johnson has seen that
employees need continuous learning and fresh challenges to stay motivated.

The best bosses know this, and they know how to make it happen by thoughtfully
designing people’s jobs around the skills they have today as well as the skills
they’ll need to be even more valuable tomorrow. That’s how entire organizations
stay competitive in an unpredictable, rapidly changing business environment.

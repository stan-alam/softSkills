## notes on Apollo Leadership

America’s decade-long effort to put a man on the moon is a compelling story. Like any great narrative it’s filled with hope and disappointment, villains and heroes, greed and sacrifice. At every step it’s the story of leadership.

With unique access to key leaders and NASA resources, author Dick Richardson has captured the leadership insights of our journey to the moon. These lessons are told through the lens of the people who were there–the executives, flight directors, and astronauts. Many contributed directly to this book. Richardson helps us see them as real people facing real opportunities and challenges.

You may not go to the moon, but this book will help you apply NASA’s leadership lessons to your company’s mission.

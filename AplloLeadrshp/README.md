## notes on Apollo Leadership

America’s decade-long effort to put a man on the moon is a compelling story. Like any great narrative it’s filled with hope and disappointment, villains and heroes, greed and sacrifice. At every step it’s the story of leadership.

With unique access to key leaders and NASA resources, author Dick Richardson has captured the leadership insights of our journey to the moon. These lessons are told through the lens of the people who were there–the executives, flight directors, and astronauts. Many contributed directly to this book. Richardson helps us see them as real people facing real opportunities and challenges.

You may not go to the moon, but this book will help you apply NASA’s leadership lessons to your company’s mission.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Dick Richardson has been recognized with numerous awards in leadership development and learning. After years in the corporate world, he founded Experience to Lead, offering unique experiences to improve the leadership of individuals, teams, and organizations. His firm offers a variety of immersive programs for senior leaders, including the Apollo Leadership Experience. His relationships with NASA, the Smithsonian Institute, and Space Center Houston have allowed unique behind-the-scenes access for executives to learn the inner workings of the nation’s space program. Apollo Leadership Lessons is a direct result of his work with NASA executives and astronauts.


"Dick Richardson is a masterful storyteller and highly skilled at leadership development."

"prominent Apollo leaders—from astronauts to flight directors, rocket scientists to managers, presidents to administrators—and weave their significant leadership lessons into easy to understand and practical applications for today. I have been fortunate to have known and worked with many of these people and Dick is right on the mark with his analysis and leadership discussions."

"C. S. Lewis said, “Friendship is the instrument by which God reveals to us the beauty of others.” Dick has taught me the beauty of leaders learning from other leaders."

**"Those people took the United States from a lofty goal to the accomplishment of the moon landing mission that many thought was impossible. Dick Richardson is able to draw insights into how they helped lead NASA to begin the exploration of space, and how you might apply them to your situation. Read the book. You may be spurred on to lead others to do things that are hard to do or even imagine."**

"that footprint remains, exactly as it was left by Neil Armstrong, a monument to human innovation, dedication, and leadership. I selected that image as a metaphor for the leadership insights we can gain from NASA’s Apollo Program. The legacy of the leaders who made that footprint possible is what this book is about."

"Although the astronauts are the stars of the space program, it’s the thousands of leaders, executives, managers, and engineers who actually made that footprint possible that we can learn from. Through their smart management decisions, the Apollo program successfully brought Americans to the moon."

"von Braun’s ability to adapt as leader laid the foundation for America’s rocket program. His pivotal decision to get behind the US and apply his expertise"

"His message, and the way he conveyed it, is a model for communication that scholars have studied and that leaders should, too."

"succeeded because decisions were made by leveraging the unique expertise of each individual."

T-shaped leadership, as it’s now called, first gained prominence in the Information Technology field. You can benefit from it too."

We see how understanding social and cultural capital can allow leaders to help themselves or other people with different backgrounds to “fit in” and to support talented people to get ahead."

"Flight Director Glynn Lunney is a prime example of a leader who helped those on his team achieve more because of his guidance and encouragement. He showed them respect and appreciation and they gave him their very best work and loyalty."

"Chapter nine looks at the Apollo program after it recovered from the Apollo 1 fire and the important role George Low played in getting things back on track. The chance of another accident was high, so he had to help his team effectively balance the risk of a problem with the potential for a huge reward—the first successful moon mission."

**Chapter eleven’s focus is on ethics within the space program."**

"Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun was the epitome of an adaptive leader. His career and dreams of space flight were repeatedly thwarted by war, politics, cultural rejection, organizational barriers, and, of course, technical failures."

"Given the various forces nearing his team’s location, he believed his choices for takeover were Russia, whose army was quickly closing in; France; England; or the US. For von Braun, the choice was easy—he wanted to work in the US. Von Braun approached this like a business problem. This was similar to an acquisition or merger. What steps could he take to make his team at Peenemünde an attractive acquisition target? He wanted the US to “acquire” his business."

"When NASA was formed in 1958, von Braun was offered a role, but he didn’t want just any job, he wanted to be responsible for developing a huge rocket capable of landing on the moon."

"Von Braun’s greatest strength was his intellect and strategic mind. He was forever imagining different futures for himself, his team, and his country, finding new potential paths to achieve his vision of space exploration. By thinking through the myriad potential next steps in his career, he was always prepared to adapt and pivot as needed. He was unusual in that regard. We humans get tunnel vision easily. We tend to focus almost exclusively on our area of expertise—the lane that we’re swimming in, as it were—to ensure we’re up-to-date and well-informed about industry happenings. Engineers focus on shifts occurring in the engineering field, marketers focus on changes in marketing that are underway"

"Engineers are caught off-guard by social changes. Politicians are surprised by technology advances. Physicians are unaware of marketing opportunities or shifts. We lose sight of the broader picture."

"Adaptive leaders, like von Braun, avoid the trap of being hyper-focused on one area and excluding others by constantly scanning their environment. They routinely look outside their normal spheres of interest to stay current on larger issues. The result is a level of flexibility and adaptability to change that can be a source of competitive advantage."

**"An environmental scan is a macro assessment"**

"Environmental scans can be very detailed and complex, or more ad hoc. The goal of such scans is to provide leaders with situational awareness—to be more aware of the forces that could impact their organization positively or negatively."

"Leaders should routinely examine multiple environmental factors to broaden their perspectives. These factors include, but are not limited to: Politics and government. This includes regulatory agencies and legislation such as Brexit, net neutrality, and two-for-one regulation repeal."

**"Social and demographic changes. These include events such as the evolving definition of gender, LGBTQI issues, immigration, generational conflicts, and dislocation. Legal. Recent legal issues include our increasingly litigious society, automated legal systems, and changing Chinese treatment of intellectual property, for example. Geophysical. Climate change and conflict are two types of geophysical events that drive economic and population shifts. Technological. Monitoring constant changes in technology is smart, where we’re currently seeing advances in artificial intelligence that affect future employment and the rise in ransomware, for example. Economic. Economic events like the rising price of oil, housing bubbles, and currency fluctuations can also impact future opportunities"**

"Competitors and suppliers. As barriers to entry and exit rise and fall, new competitors emerge. We’ve seen this as Amazon moves into brick-and-mortar through its recent acquisition of Whole Foods. New suppliers can be formed, changing the marketplace dynamic. Customers. Shifting consumer demographics, rising preference for online transactions, and the impact of social media on shopping habits are all issues impacting customers."

"Constantly monitoring and studying what is happening in all eight of these areas provides leaders with a broader, richer understanding of their environment—past, present, and future. But environmental scanning, as this monitoring is called, is not just about identifying trends."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Your goal isn’t to identify the one most likely path to success, but rather the myriad different possible paths. Then, how best to respond depending on the specific path taken. And as each environmental change forces a course correction toward your goal, new potential paths also emerge."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Von Braun, for example, stayed current on events occurring in the military, political, economic, legal, and social environment in 1944, rather than focusing intently on the technical projects assigned to him, as many of his colleagues and other technical leaders did. For that reason, he was better informed and could envision potential future options those around him could never have imagined."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Von Braun was capable of adapting because he was constantly looking at his situation and his ecosystem from multiple perspectives. Most leaders get so caught up in their own world, and their own problems, that they fail to take a broader view of their situation. In contrast, von Braun regularly looked outside of his normal spheres of interest. In doing so, he recognized one of many paths he and his team could take. As his environment shifted, his strategies shifted, which sometimes required unconventional action by his team."

"German leaders, on the other hand, who were hyper-focused on the military and political battlefield could only see certain victory. Von Braun was right, they were wrong. Adaptive leaders gather information in order to understand their environment and are constantly"

"analyzing it in order to assess what to do about it, keeping their ultimate goal in the forefront of their minds. Von Braun’s ultimate goal was making spaceflight possible."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"While adaptive leadership occurs during times of great change, it’s also what makes great progress possible. Adaptive leadership leverages past knowledge and experience and mobilizes teams to foster progress beyond what was previously thought possible. Adaptive leaders make impossible things possible."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Leadership Experience To help you apply what you’ve learned about adaptive leadership and Wernher von Braun’s work within NASA, consider these questions: What is your guiding vision? Think long term strategically and mid-term operationally. How can you gain different perspectives of your organization’s environment? How can you do more contingency planning—imagining alternate paths to achieving your ends? What allies will you need to be successful? What are you willing to sacrifice and not sacrifice to achieve your goals? Chapter 2 John F. Kennedy—Nurturing a Vision “Keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground.” —Franklin D. Roosevelt I learned a simple definition of leadership from General John Wattendorf, Department Head, Behavioral Sciences and Leadership at West Point Military Academy. “Leadership is influencing others to do what they would not do if left to their own accord.”"

"What made these speeches so persuasive was not necessarily their oration, but their vision and appeal to the heart as well as the mind. These leaders understood the importance of painting a picture of possibility as a first step toward making their vision a reality. Once visualized, their challenge was bringing that goal to fruition."

"challenged Americans to move past the country’s failure to get a man into space first and to look ahead to the future—a future that could include putting an American on the moon. It would take hardship and hard work, and a massive budget, but if everyone was committed, we could get there in ten years, he promised."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"He knew that the US couldn’t compete head-to-head with the USSR. They were ahead in every way. Kennedy began looking for other options—a way to change the playing field, as it were."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"we have examined where we are strong and where we are not, where we may succeed and where we may not. Now it is time to take longer strides-time for a great new American enterprise-time for this nation to take a clearly leading role in space achievement, which in many ways may hold the key to our future on earth.”"
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"His speech then shifted to the present, hinting at the fact that no matter what we do, Russia would continue with its space program: “the exploration of space will go ahead, whether we join in it or not.”"

Simple words. Kennedy doesn’t try to impress by using multisyllabic words no one recognizes. Instead, he used words everyone in the audience is familiar with. He makes the information he’s sharing accessible, understandable. Short sentences. Kennedy also makes sure not to use run-on sentences with several ideas or concepts jumbled together. He uses short, crisp sentences containing a single idea at a time. Systematic. Each sentence builds on the last, like stepping stones on a path to his key"
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"point. When Kennedy makes a statement, he then backs it up with an explanation or proof. He makes his point in a methodical way. No extra fluff. He chooses his words carefully, packing a punch in as few words as possible. There’s little in the way of extraneous verbiage here, but he does choose words that generate an emotional response whenever possible, such as “pride” or “un-tried.” Repetition. Many of the great speeches, including Kennedy’s, use repetition for effect. Abraham Lincoln repeated the words “can not” in the Gettysburg address: “Can not dedicate…can not consecrate…can not hallow…” and “of the people, by the people, for the people.” Similarly, Kennedy used the phrase “We choose” three times in his speech, just as Martin Luther King, Jr. used the phrase “Now is the time.”"

**"Rather than feeling like the odd man out, however, Webb “discovered he could match"
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"**

**"or even outstrip the achievements of people more privileged than himself.”16 That was a life-changing lesson that shaped how he viewed his future prospects. After the Marine Corps, he enrolled in law school, which introduced him to a new circle of friends. Many were government officials; he “turned out to be a smart political operator.”17 He then landed a job as a secretary to North Carolina Senator Edward Pou and made more political friends."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"**

"During that time, he did more than think—he actively assessed his own strengths and weaknesses and asked for feedback from the people around him—an informal 360-degree assessment. He wanted an objective appraisal of his ability to succeed in the NASA role. The people who knew him best told him that the NASA job required skills he did not have. He was weak in his understanding of technology and weak in operational experience—two skills"
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Given what he had gleaned about the space program and where he might fit, Webb stated that, “I would not take the job if I could honorably and properly not take it.”18 Meaning, unless forced into it, he would decline."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"So, he appealed to ally and friend Frank Pace, the CEO of General Dynamics. Pace also tried to change Johnson’s mind, but without success. Seventeen other candidates had already declined the opportunity. Johnson was fed up—he didn’t want an eighteenth refusal."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Pace quickly came out and Johnson yelled out his office door, “Webb, get in here!”"
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Aviation Week & Space Technology magazine expressed its lack of confidence in Webb’s skills. “The president should have appointed a technically competent manager.”"
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Webb had tried valiantly to avoid falling victim to the Dunning-Kruger effect. Dunning and Kruger are Cornell psychology professors whose research found that people are poor judges of their own skills and abilities. That is, there is a general tendency (especially by men) to overestimate one’s own skills. Or, as David Dunning explained to The Atlantic,20 “incompetent people do not recognize—scratch that, cannot recognize—just how incompetent they are.” Competent people also have a tendency to overestimate their capabilities. In a 2000 study of Stanford MBA students,21 eighty-seven percent rated their academic performance as above average. Given that only fifty percent of the class could actually be above the median, a large percentage of students in the class has overestimated their GPA and, perhaps, their skills. The study found that less proficient individuals were much more likely to overestimate their own level of skill and to downplay the true talents of others. However, the Dunning-Kruger trap isn’t limited to the less-skilled, only more likely to appear. The truth is, even gifted athletes have fallen victim—Michael Jordan, for example. Jordan is certainly one of the top three or four basketball players of all time. Named “Athlete of the Century"
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Century” by ESPN, he is among the very elite in terms of athletic skill. Where he stumbled, however, was in assuming that his basketball prowess would carry over into other sports."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Although Jordan had succumbed to the Dunning-Kruger trap, Webb tried hard not to."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Using 360-degree assessments to get feedback. Webb approached friends and colleagues who knew him in various capacities and asked for their frank evaluation of his skills. He wanted to know how others perceived him. He asked for examples to better understand what he was doing right and where he could improve. Using psychometric instruments. While people around you can provide hard data about how you think and act, tools like those found in First Break All the Rules: What the World’s Greatest Managers Do Differently, provide insights into your strengths and weaknesses from an internal perspective."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"How do you instinctively react in certain situations, what environments bring out the best in you and which make you focus inward, what types of tasks do you gravitate towards—those are pieces of information others might not necessarily pick up on. Comparing job requirements to personal skills. Using Webb’s approach as a role model, a simple exercise you can do that will more clearly determine how well your skills line up with the requirements of the job you are considering, or are currently in, is to take two sheets of blank paper. Title one: “The job success requirements.” Title the second: “My personal skills.” On the first write out what the job entails and what types of skills and abilities will be key to performing well in that role. Then, on the other sheet, list your strengths."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Apollo at Delphi. Great leaders know themselves well. In Webb’s case, he went so far as to create an innovative organization designed to better run NASA."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"Having accepted a job at which he knew he was likely to fail, Webb took steps to compensate for his weaknesses using collaborative decision-making—essentially sharing decision-making responsibility and authority with others."
― from "Apollo Leadership Lessons: Powerful Business Insights for Executives"

"then hired Robert Seamans, the former COO of RCA, who had the experience running an organization of that size that Webb lacked. Together, the three became known as The Triad, which was a new way of governing at the top."

The legacy of the leaders who made that footprint possible is what this book is about.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

For von Braun, the choice was easy—he wanted to work in the US. Von Braun approached this like a business problem. This was similar to an acquisition or merger. What steps could he take to make his team at Peenemünde an attractive acquisition target? He wanted the US to “acquire” his business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Adaptive leaders must simultaneously pay attention to the day-to-day details of what’s happening within their organizations as well as the 35,000-foot view, where they get a broader perspective on what’s happening and why. “Sustaining good leadership, then, requires first and foremost the capacity to see what is happening to you and your initiative as it is happening and to understand how today’s turns in the road will affect tomorrow’s plans,” explain Heifetz and Linsky.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

Most leaders get so caught up in their own world, and their own problems, that they fail to take a broader view of their situation. In contrast, von Braun regularly looked outside of his normal spheres of interest. In doing so, he recognized one of many paths he and his team could take. As his environment shifted, his strategies shifted, which sometimes required unconventional action by his team.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Think long term strategically and mid-term operationally. How can you gain different perspectives of your organization’s environment? How can you do more contingency planning—imagining alternate paths to achieving your ends? What allies will you need to be successful? What are you willing to sacrifice and not sacrifice to achieve your goals? Chapter 2 John F. Kennedy—Nurturing a Vision “Keep your eyes on the stars and your feet on the ground.” —Franklin D.

He makes his point in a methodical way. No extra fluff. He chooses his words carefully, packing a punch in as few words as possible. There’s little in the way of extraneous verbiage here, but he does choose words that generate an emotional response whenever possible, such as “pride” or “un-tried.” Repetition. Many of the great speeches, including Kennedy’s, use repetition for effect. Abraham Lincoln repeated the words “can not” in the Gettysburg address: “Can not dedicate…can not consecrate…can not hallow…” and “of the people, by the people, for the people.” Similarly, Kennedy used the phrase “We choose” three times in his speech, just as Martin Luther King, Jr. used the phrase “Now is the time.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Dunning and Kruger are Cornell psychology professors whose research found that people are poor judges of their own skills and abilities. That is, there is a general tendency (especially by men) to overestimate one’s own skills. Or, as David Dunning explained to The Atlantic,20 “incompetent people do not recognize—scratch that, cannot recognize—just how incompetent they are.” Competent people also have a tendency to overestimate their capabilities. In a 2000 study of Stanford MBA students,21 eighty-seven percent rated their academic performance as above average. Given that only fifty percent of the class could actually be above the median, a large percentage of students in the class has overestimated their GPA and, perhaps, their skills. The study found that less proficient individuals were much more likely to overestimate their own level of skill and to downplay the true talents of others. However, the Dunning-Kruger trap isn’t limited to the less-skilled, only more likely to appear. The truth is, even gifted athletes have fallen victim—Michael Jordan, for example. Jordan is certainly one of the top three or four basketball players of all time. Named “Athlete of the Century” by ESPN, he is among the very elite in terms of athletic skill. Where he stumbled, however, was in assuming that his basketball prowess would carry over into other sports.|

Comparing job requirements to personal skills. Using Webb’s approach as a role model, a simple exercise you can do that will more clearly determine how well your skills line up with the requirements of the job you are considering, or are currently in, is to take two sheets of blank paper. Title one: “The job success requirements.” Title the second: “My personal skills.” On the first write out what the job entails and what types of skills and abilities will be key to performing well in that role. Then, on the other sheet, list your strengths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Their diversity of education, experience, and interests provided what Webb called “a whole brain.” We tend to hire people like ourselves. Webb had the awareness to not do that. Delegate. Find others equally or better qualified than you to whom you can hand off responsibilities. For example, I hate running meetings. I don’t enjoy leading them, nor do I think I do a particularly good job, so I regularly ask others to take the lead in my place. I still attend and offer input, but I’m not the person driving the agenda. This also allows me to be a better listener.

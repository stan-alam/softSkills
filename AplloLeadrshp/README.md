## notes on Apollo Leadership

America’s decade-long effort to put a man on the moon is a compelling story. Like any great narrative it’s filled with hope and disappointment, villains and heroes, greed and sacrifice. At every step it’s the story of leadership.

With unique access to key leaders and NASA resources, author Dick Richardson has captured the leadership insights of our journey to the moon. These lessons are told through the lens of the people who were there–the executives, flight directors, and astronauts. Many contributed directly to this book. Richardson helps us see them as real people facing real opportunities and challenges.

You may not go to the moon, but this book will help you apply NASA’s leadership lessons to your company’s mission.

ABOUT THE AUTHOR

Dick Richardson has been recognized with numerous awards in leadership development and learning. After years in the corporate world, he founded Experience to Lead, offering unique experiences to improve the leadership of individuals, teams, and organizations. His firm offers a variety of immersive programs for senior leaders, including the Apollo Leadership Experience. His relationships with NASA, the Smithsonian Institute, and Space Center Houston have allowed unique behind-the-scenes access for executives to learn the inner workings of the nation’s space program. Apollo Leadership Lessons is a direct result of his work with NASA executives and astronauts.


"Dick Richardson is a masterful storyteller and highly skilled at leadership development."

"prominent Apollo leaders—from astronauts to flight directors, rocket scientists to managers, presidents to administrators—and weave their significant leadership lessons into easy to understand and practical applications for today. I have been fortunate to have known and worked with many of these people and Dick is right on the mark with his analysis and leadership discussions."

"C. S. Lewis said, “Friendship is the instrument by which God reveals to us the beauty of others.” Dick has taught me the beauty of leaders learning from other leaders."

**"Those people took the United States from a lofty goal to the accomplishment of the moon landing mission that many thought was impossible. Dick Richardson is able to draw insights into how they helped lead NASA to begin the exploration of space, and how you might apply them to your situation. Read the book. You may be spurred on to lead others to do things that are hard to do or even imagine."**

"that footprint remains, exactly as it was left by Neil Armstrong, a monument to human innovation, dedication, and leadership. I selected that image as a metaphor for the leadership insights we can gain from NASA’s Apollo Program. The legacy of the leaders who made that footprint possible is what this book is about."

"Although the astronauts are the stars of the space program, it’s the thousands of leaders, executives, managers, and engineers who actually made that footprint possible that we can learn from. Through their smart management decisions, the Apollo program successfully brought Americans to the moon."

"von Braun’s ability to adapt as leader laid the foundation for America’s rocket program. His pivotal decision to get behind the US and apply his expertise"

"His message, and the way he conveyed it, is a model for communication that scholars have studied and that leaders should, too."

"succeeded because decisions were made by leveraging the unique expertise of each individual."

10. study Wernher von Braun again in chapter five, because he illustrates the value of having deep expertise in one functional area while striving to have breadth across all the areas in which executives have to lead. T-shaped leadership, as it’s now called, first gained prominence in the Information Technology field. You can benefit from it too."

We see how understanding social and cultural capital can allow leaders to help themselves or other people with different backgrounds to “fit in” and to support talented people to get ahead."

"Flight Director Glynn Lunney is a prime example of a leader who helped those on his team achieve more because of his guidance and encouragement. He showed them respect and appreciation and they gave him their very best work and loyalty."

"Chapter nine looks at the Apollo program after it recovered from the Apollo 1 fire and the important role George Low played in getting things back on track. The chance of another accident was high, so he had to help his team effectively balance the risk of a problem with the potential for a huge reward—the first successful moon mission."

**Chapter eleven’s focus is on ethics within the space program."**

"Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun was the epitome of an adaptive leader. His career and dreams of space flight were repeatedly thwarted by war, politics, cultural rejection, organizational barriers, and, of course, technical failures."

"Given the various forces nearing his team’s location, he believed his choices for takeover were Russia, whose army was quickly closing in; France; England; or the US. For von Braun, the choice was easy—he wanted to work in the US. Von Braun approached this like a business problem. This was similar to an acquisition or merger. What steps could he take to make his team at Peenemünde an attractive acquisition target? He wanted the US to “acquire” his business."

"When NASA was formed in 1958, von Braun was offered a role, but he didn’t want just any job, he wanted to be responsible for developing a huge rocket capable of landing on the moon."

"Von Braun’s greatest strength was his intellect and strategic mind. He was forever imagining different futures for himself, his team, and his country, finding new potential paths to achieve his vision of space exploration. By thinking through the myriad potential next steps in his career, he was always prepared to adapt and pivot as needed. He was unusual in that regard. We humans get tunnel vision easily. We tend to focus almost exclusively on our area of expertise—the lane that we’re swimming in, as it were—to ensure we’re up-to-date and well-informed about industry happenings. Engineers focus on shifts occurring in the engineering field, marketers focus on changes in marketing that are underway"

"Engineers are caught off-guard by social changes. Politicians are surprised by technology advances. Physicians are unaware of marketing opportunities or shifts. We lose sight of the broader picture."

"Adaptive leaders, like von Braun, avoid the trap of being hyper-focused on one area and excluding others by constantly scanning their environment. They routinely look outside their normal spheres of interest to stay current on larger issues. The result is a level of flexibility and adaptability to change that can be a source of competitive advantage."

**"An environmental scan is a macro assessment"**

## notes on automatic customer

```text
The lifeblood of your business is repeat customers. But customers can be fickle,
markets shift, and competitors are ruthless. So how do you ensure a steady flow of repeat
business? The secret—no matter what industry you’re in—is finding and keeping automatic
customers.

These days virtually anything you need can be purchased through a subscription, with more
convenience than ever before. Far beyond Spotify, Netflix, and New York Times subscriptions,
you can sign up for weekly or monthly supplies of everything from groceries (AmazonFresh) to
cosmetics (Birchbox) to razor blades (Dollar Shave Club).

According to John Warrillow, this emerging subscription economy offers huge opportunities to
companies that know how to turn customers into subscribers. Automatic customers are the key to
increasing cash flow, igniting growth, and boosting the value of your company.

Consider Whatsapp, the internet-based messaging service that was purchased by Facebook for $19
billion. While other services bombarded users with invasive ads in order to fund a free messaging
platform, Whatsapp offered a refreshingly private tool on a subscription platform,
charging just $1 per year. Their business model enabled the kind of service that customers wanted and
ensured automatic customers for years to come.

As Warrillow shows, subscriptions aren’t limited to technology or media businesses.
Companies in nearly any industry, from start-ups to the Fortune 500, from home
contractors to florists, can build subscriptions into their business.

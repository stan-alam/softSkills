## notes on Subscribed: Why the Subscription Model Will Be Your Company’s Future
**Tien Tzuo**
```text
Subscription companies are growing nine times faster than the S&P 500. Why?
Because unlike product companies, subscription companies know their customers.
A happy subscriber base is the ultimate economic moat.

Today’s consumers prefer the advantages of access over the hassles of maintenance,
from transportation (Uber, Surf Air), to clothing (Stitch Fix, Eleven James),
to razor blades and makeup (Dollar Shave Club, Birchbox). Companies are
similarly demanding easier, long-term solutions, trading their server rooms
for cloud storage solutions like Box. Simply put, the world is shifting
from products to services.

But how do you turn customers into subscribers? As the CEO of the world’s
largest subscription management platform, Tien Tzuo has helped hundreds of
companies transition from relying on individual sales to building customer-centric,
recurring-revenue businesses. His core message in Subscribed is simple:
Ready or not, excited or terrified, you need to adapt to the Subscription
Economy — or risk being left behind.

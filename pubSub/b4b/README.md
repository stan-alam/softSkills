## notes on B4B

```text
Industry after industry is becoming technology-driven as software rapidly eats the world.
As it spreads, so do complexity and opportunity. There are clear signs that the traditional
B2B business model designed 125 years ago as a simple “make, sell, ship” approach for early
manufacturing companies is no longer capable of delivering the full potential of high-tech
and near-tech solutions. B4B seeks to frame what is possible in an age where suppliers are
connected to their customers in real time. The traditional world of B2B was designed to sell
things to customers, whereas the new B4B model will be about delivering outcomes for customers.
It’s a whole new ballgame. Using powerful models and specific examples, B4B envisions a
next-generation tech industry where suppliers play an active, ongoing role in helping business
customers achieve unparalleled value from their technology investments.

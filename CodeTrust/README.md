Robin Dreeke is a 28-year veteran of federal service, including the United
States Naval Academy, United States Marine Corps. He served most recently
as a senior agent in the FBI, with 20 years of experience. He was, until
recently, the head of the Counterintelligence Behavioral Analysis Program,
where his primary mission was to thwart the efforts of foreign spies,
and to recruit American spies. His core approach in this mission was to
inspire reasonable, well-founded trust among people who could provide
valuable information.

The Code of Trust is based on the system Dreeke devised, tested,
and implemented during years of field work at the highest levels
of national security. Applying his system first to himself, he rose up
through federal law enforcement, and then taught his system to law
enforcement and military officials throughout the country, and
later to private sector clients. The Code of Trust has since
elevated executives to leadership, and changed the culture of
entire companies, making them happier and more productive, as morale soared.

Inspiring trust is not a trick, nor is it an arcane art.
Itâ€™s an important, character-building endeavor that
requires only a sincere desire to be helpful and
sensitive, and the ambition to be more successful at work
and at home. The Code of Trust is based on 5 simple principles:

1) Suspend Your Ego
2) Be Nonjudgmental
3) Honor Reason
4) Validate Others
5) Be Generous

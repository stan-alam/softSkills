## notes on Positive Relationships

Relationships are at the heart of our lives; at home with our families, with our friends, in schools and colleges, with colleagues at the workplace and in our diverse communities. The quality of these relationships determines our individual well-being, how well we learn, develop and function, our sense of connectedness with others and the health so society. This unique volume brings together authorities from across the world to write about how relationships might be enhanced in all these different areas of our lives. It also explores how to address the challenges involved in establishing and maintaining positive relationships. This evidence-based book, primarily grounded in the science of positive psychology, is valuable for academics, especially psychologists and professionals, working in the field of well-being.

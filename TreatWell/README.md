## Treating People Well: The Extraordinary Power of Civility at Work and in Life
**Lea Berman**

```
A guide to personal and professional empowerment through civility and social
skills, written by two White House Social Secretaries who offer an important
fundamental message—everyone is important and everyone deserves to be treated
 well.

Former White House social secretaries Lea Berman, who worked for George and
Laura Bush, and Jeremy Bernard, who worked for Michelle and Barack Obama,
have written an entertaining and uniquely practical guide to personal and
professional success in modern life. Their daily experiences at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue taught them valuable lessons about how to work
productively with people from different walks of life and points of view.
These Washington insiders share what they’ve learned through first person
examples of their own glamorous (and sometimes harrowing) moments with
celebrities, foreign leaders and that most unpredictable of animals—the
American politician.

This book is for you if you feel unsure of yourself in social settings,
if you’d like to get along more easily with others, or if you want to break
through to a new level of cooperation with your boss and coworkers.
They give specific advice for how to exude confidence even when you don’t
feel it, ways to establish your reputation as an individual whom people
like, trust, and want to help, and lay out the specific social skills
still essential to success – despite our increasingly digitized world.
Jeremy and Lea prove that social skills are learned behavior that anyone
can acquire, and tell the stories of their own unlikely paths to becoming
the social arbiters of the White House, while providing tantalizing
insights into the character of the first ladies and presidents they served.

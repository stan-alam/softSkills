## notes on 'The Enchanted Hour'

```text
A miraculous alchemy occurs when one person reads to another, transforming the
simple stuff of a book, a voice, and a bit of time into complex and powerful fuel
for the heart, brain, and imagination. Grounded in the latest neuroscience and
behavioral research, and drawing widely from literature, The Enchanted Hour explains
the dazzling cognitive and social-emotional benefits that await children, whatever
their class, nationality or family background. But it’s not just about bedtime stories
for little kids: Reading aloud consoles, uplifts and invigorates at every age,
deepening the intellectual lives and emotional well-being of teenagers and adults, too.

Meghan Cox Gurdon argues that this ancient practice is a fast-working antidote to
the fractured attention spans, atomized families and unfulfilling ephemera of the
tech era, helping to replenish what our devices are leaching away. For everyone,
reading aloud engages the mind in complex narratives; for children, it’s an
irreplaceable gift that builds vocabulary, fosters imagination, and kindles a
lifelong appreciation of language, stories and pictures.

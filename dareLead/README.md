## Notes on Dare to Lead

```text
Leadership is not about titles, status, and wielding power. A leader is anyone who
takes responsibility for recognizing the potential in people and ideas, and has
the courage to develop that potential.

When we dare to lead, we don’t pretend to have the right answers; we stay curious
and ask the right questions. We don’t see power as finite and hoard it; we know
that power becomes infinite when we share it with others. We don’t avoid difficult
conversations and situations; we lean into vulnerability when it’s necessary to do good work.

But daring leadership in a culture defined by scarcity, fear, and uncertainty
requires skill-building around traits that are deeply and uniquely human.
The irony is that we’re choosing not to invest in developing the hearts and
minds of leaders at the exact same time as we’re scrambling to figure out
what we have to offer that machines and AI can’t do better and faster. What
can we do better? Empathy, connection, and courage, to start.

## notes on 'Cracking the Product Manager interview'

```text
How many pizzas are delivered in Manhattan? How do you design an alarm clock for the
blind? What is your favorite piece of software and why? How would you launch a video
rental service in India? This book will teach you how to answer these questions and more.

Cracking the PM Interview is a comprehensive book about landing a product management
role in a startup or bigger tech company. Learn how the ambiguously-named “PM”
(product manager / program manager) role varies across companies, what experience you need,
how to make your existing experience translate, what a great PM resume and cover letter
look like, and finally, how to master the PM interview questions (estimation questions,
  behavioral questions, case questions, product questions, technical questions, and the
  super important “pitch”).

“If you were looking for a comprehensive, well-researched book about how to get a job in
product management, look no further than Cracking the PM Interview. Gayle and Jackie break
down the entire process of landing your dream PM job, while bridging a wide range of
perspectives that aspiring PMs may bring to the table. This is a no-brainer resource to
leverage during your job search.” ~ Jason Shah, former Product Manager at
Yammer/Microsoft & instructor of How to Get a Job in Product Management

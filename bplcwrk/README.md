## notes on The Best Place to Work

```text
For readers of Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Pink, and Freakonomics, comes a captivating and
surprising journey through the science of workplace excellence.

Why do successful companies reward failure? What can casinos teach us about building a
happy workplace? How do you design an office that enhances both attention to detail and creativity?

In The Best Place to Work, award-winning psychologist Ron Friedman, Ph.D. uses the
latest research from the fields of motivation, creativity, behavioral economics,
neuroscience, and management to reveal what really makes us successful at work.
Combining powerful stories with cutting edge findings, Friedman shows leaders at
 every level how they can use scientifically-proven techniques to promote smarter
 thinking, greater innovation, and stronger performance.

Among the many surprising insights, Friedman explains how learning to think like a
hostage negotiator can help you diffuse a workplace argument, why placing a fish
bowl near your desk can elevate your thinking, and how incorporating strategic
distractions into your schedule can help you reach smarter decisions. Along the way,
the book introduces the inventor who created the cubicle, the president who brought
down the world’s most dangerous criminal, and the teenager who single-handedly
transformed professional tennis—vivid stories that offer unexpected revelations on
achieving workplace excellence.

Brimming with counterintuitive insights and actionable recommendations, The Best
Place to Workoffers employees and executives alike game-changing advice for working
smarter and turning any organization—regardless of its size, budgets, or
ambitions—into an extraordinary workplace.

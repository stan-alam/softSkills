## notes on Nudge

```text
Every day we make choices—about what to buy or eat, about financial investments
or our children’s health and education, even about the causes we champion or the
planet itself. Unfortunately, we often choose poorly. Nudge is about how we make
these choices and how we can make better ones. Using dozens of eye-opening examples a
nd drawing on decades of behavioral science research, Nobel Prize winner Richard H.
Thaler and Harvard Law School professor Cass R. Sunstein show that no choice is ever
 presented to us in a neutral way, and that we are all susceptible to biases that can
 lead us to make bad decisions. But by knowing how people think, we can use sensible
 “choice architecture” to nudge people toward the best decisions for ourselves, our
 families, and our society, without restricting our freedom of choice.

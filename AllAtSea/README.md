## notes on All at Sea

```text
A beautifully written, breathtakingly honest, unsentimental, and profound memoir
from one of the UK’s most popular journalists.

On a hot, still morning on a beautiful beach in Jamaica, Decca Aitkenhead’s
life changed forever. Her four-year-old son was paddling peacefully at the water’s
edge when a wave pulled him out to sea. Her partner, Tony, swam out and saved their
son’s life—then drowned before her eyes.

When Decca and Tony first met, a decade earlier, she was a renowned Guardian
journalist profiling leading politicians of the day; he was a dreadlocked criminal
with a history of drug dealing and violence. No one thought the romance would last,
but it did—until the tide swept Tony away, plunging Decca into the dark chasm of random tragedy.

Exploring race and redemption, privilege and prejudice, All at Sea is a remarkable story
of love and loss, of how one couple changed each other’s life, and of what a sudden death
can do to the people who survive.

“Raw, unremitting emotion grounds the book and makes it compelling on a nearly visceral
level … Intense and surprising from start to finish.”
—Booklist

“That [Aitkenhead] and her partner were able to learn from each other and work through
their race and class differences to form a cohesive family unit make the book memorable.
But in the end, it is the author’s resilience after her lover’s death—which she describes
with poised eloquence—that renders the narrative especially satisfying. An unsentimental
yet affecting memoir.”
—Kirkus Reviews

## measure what matters

```text
In the fall of 1999, John Doerr met with the founders of a start-up whom he’d just
given $12.5 million, the biggest investment of his career. Larry Page and Sergey
Brin had amazing technology, entrepreneurial energy, and sky-high ambitions, but
no real business plan. For Google to change the world (or even to survive), Page and
Brin had to learn how to make tough choices on priorities while keeping their team on
track. They’d have to know when to pull the plug on losing propositions, to fail fast.
And they needed timely, relevant data to track their progress—to measure what mattered.

Doerr taught them about a proven approach to operating excellence: Objectives and Key
Results. He had first discovered OKRs in the 1970s as an engineer at Intel, where the
legendary Andy Grove (“the greatest manager of his or any era”) drove the best-run
company Doerr had ever seen. Later, as a venture capitalist, Doerr shared Grove’s
brainchild with more than fifty companies. Wherever the process was faithfully practiced,
it worked.

In this goal-setting system, objectives define what we seek to achieve; key results
are how those top-priority goals will be attained with specific, measurable actions
within a set time frame. Everyone’s goals, from entry-level to CEO, are transparent to the entire organization.

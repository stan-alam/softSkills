## notes on Leap of Trust

```text
We’re not supposed to trust others. Look at the headlines. Read the blogs.
Study the survey data. It seems that everyone is wary, that everyone is just
looking out for themselves. But a sense of social trust and togetherness can be restored.

In The Leap, best-selling author Ulrich Boser shows how the emerging research on trust
can improve our lives, rebuild our economy, and strengthen society. As part of this engaging
and deeply reported narrative, Boser visits a radio soap opera in Rwanda that aims to restore
the country’s broken trust, profiles the man who brought honesty to one of the most corrupt cities
in Latin America, and explains how a college dropout managed to con his way into American high society.
Boser even goes skydiving to see if the experience will increase his levels of oxytocin, the so-called
“trust hormone.”

A powerful mix of hard science and compelling storytelling, The Leap explores how we trust, why we
trust, and what we can all do to deepen social trust. The book includes insightful policy recommendations
along with surprising new data on the state of social trust in America today.

“While the headlines often highlight differences, humans want to trust others. Our brains are
hardwired to do so; they secrete Oxytocin, a neurotransmitter that increases the bonding urge…
The bottom line: Oxytocin aside, trust remains a choice that builds from considering and
understanding the perspectives of others.” —Jim Pawlak, Biz Books Reviews

“Why should we all take a leap of faith into the world of trust? Ulrich Boser provides the
profound answer in this thorough, insightful analysis of the psychology of social connectedness
 where we weigh communal interest over self-interest, selflessness over selfishness,
 giving to others over being a taker.” —Philip Zimbardo, Ph.D.,
 Professor Emeritus at Stanford University and author ofThe Lucifer Effect

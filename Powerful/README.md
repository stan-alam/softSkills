When it comes to recruiting, motivating, and creating great teams, Patty McCord
says most companies have it all wrong. McCord helped create the unique and
high-performing culture at Netflix, where she was chief talent officer. In her
new book, Powerful: Building a Culture of Freedom and Responsibility, she shares
 what she learned there and elsewhere in Silicon Valley.

McCord advocates practicing radical honesty in the workplace, saying good-bye
to employees who don’t fit the company’s emerging needs, and motivating with
challenging work, not promises, perks, and bonus plans. McCord argues that
the old standbys of corporate HR—annual performance reviews, retention plans,
employee empowerment and engagement programs—often end up being a colossal
waste of time and resources. Her road-tested advice, offered with humor
and irreverence, provides readers a different path for creating a culture
of high performance and profitability.

## Notes on Zucked

```text
If you had told Roger McNamee even three years ago that he would soon be devoting
himself to stopping Facebook from destroying our democracy, he would have howled with laughter.
He had mentored many tech leaders in his illustrious career as an investor, but few things had
made him prouder, or been better for his fund’s bottom line, than his early service to Mark
Zuckerberg. Still a large shareholder in Facebook, he had every good reason to stay on the
bright side. Until he simply couldn’t.

ZUCKED is McNamee’s intimate reckoning with the catastrophic failure of the head
of one of the world’s most powerful companies to face up to the damage he is doing.
It’s a story that begins with a series of rude awakenings. First there is the author’s
dawning realization that the platform is being manipulated by some very bad actors.
Then there is the even more unsettling realization that Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg
are unable or unwilling to share his concerns, polite as they may be to his face.

And then comes the election of Donald Trump, and the emergence of one horrific
piece of news after another about the malign ends to which the Facebook platform has
been put. To McNamee’s shock, even still Facebook’s leaders duck and dissemble,
viewing the matter as a public relations problem. Now thoroughly alienated, McNamee
digs into the issue, and fortuitously meets up with some fellow travelers who share
his concern, and help him sharpen its focus. Soon he and a dream team of Silicon
Valley technologists are charging into the fray, to raise consciousness about the
existential threat of Facebook, and the persuasion architecture of the attention
economy more broadly — to our public health and to our political order.

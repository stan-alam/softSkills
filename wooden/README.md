## notes on 'Wooden on Leadership: How to Create a Winning Organization'

```text
John Wooden’s goal in 41 years of coaching never changed; namely, to get maximum effort
and peak performance from each of his players in the manner that best served the team.
Wooden on Leadership explains step-by-step how he pursued and accomplished this goal.
Focusing on Wooden’s 12 Lessons in Leadership and his acclaimed Pyramid of Success, it
outlines the mental, emotional, and physical qualities essential to building a winning
organization, and shows you how to develop the skill, confidence, and competitive fire to
“be at your best when your best is needed”–and teach your organization to do the same.

Praise for Wooden on Leadership:

“What an all-encompassing Pyramid of Success for leadership! Coach Wooden’s moral
authority and brilliant definition of success encompass all of life. How I admire his
life’s work and concept of what it really means to win!”
–Stephen R. Covey, author, The 7 Habits of Highly Successful People and The 8th Habit:
From Effectiveness to Greatness

“Wooden On Leadership offers valuable lessons no matter what your endeavor. ‘Competitive
Greatness’ is our goal and that of any successful organization. Coach Wooden’s Pyramid of
Success is where it all starts.”

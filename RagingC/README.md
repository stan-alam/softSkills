Case study:
failed leadership - **Captain Michael Davidson’s increasingly bizarre commands**

```text
On October 1, 2015, Hurricane Joaquin barreled into the Bermuda Triangle
and swallowed the container ship El Faro whole, resulting in the worst American
shipping disaster in thirty-five years. No one could fathom how a vessel
equipped with satellite communications, a sophisticated navigation system,
and cutting-edge weather forecasting could suddenly vanish—until now.

Relying on hundreds of exclusive interviews with family members and maritime
experts, as well as the words of the crew members themselves—whose conversations
were captured by the ship’s data recorder—journalist Rachel Slade unravels the
mystery of the sinking of El Faro. As she recounts the final twenty-four hours
onboard, Slade vividly depicts the officers’ anguish and fear as they struggled
to carry out Captain Michael Davidson’s increasingly bizarre commands, which,
they knew, would steer them straight into the eye of the storm. Taking a
hard look at America’s aging merchant marine fleet, Slade also reveals the
truth about modern shipping—a cut-throat industry plagued by razor-thin
profits and ever more violent hurricanes fueled by global warming.

"Davidson couldn’t afford to screw up with TOTE again. In the cutthroat world of shipping,
prudence didn’t always pay. As a master, you had to be willing to push your luck. He’d lost a
good job once before for playing it too safe when he ordered a tugboat assist after one of his
ships developed steering problems. Davidson decided to take his chances with Joaquin."

**"Nothing was more sacred aboard a ship than respecting the chain of command."**

"Though he had as much experience as Davidson, Shultz knew to defer to his captain in all
things to ingratiate himself to his superior. If he thought that sixty miles from the eye
of a major storm didn’t sound right, he kept it to himself. A challenge like that could be
viewed as insubordination."
```
**"Shultz had kids approaching college age. Like everyone else, he had expenses. He needed this job."**

"Jeremie was known for speaking his mind. Unlike the other officers aboard El Faro, he’d come up through
the hawsepipe, meaning he hadn’t graduated from one of the country’s seven maritime academies."
```

**"Instead, he’d signed on to the merchant marine as general crew when he was eighteen years old and worked his way up."**

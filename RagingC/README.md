Case study:
failed leadership - **Captain Michael Davidson’s increasingly bizarre commands**

```text
On October 1, 2015, Hurricane Joaquin barreled into the Bermuda Triangle
and swallowed the container ship El Faro whole, resulting in the worst American
shipping disaster in thirty-five years. No one could fathom how a vessel
equipped with satellite communications, a sophisticated navigation system,
and cutting-edge weather forecasting could suddenly vanish—until now.

Relying on hundreds of exclusive interviews with family members and maritime
experts, as well as the words of the crew members themselves—whose conversations
were captured by the ship’s data recorder—journalist Rachel Slade unravels the
mystery of the sinking of El Faro. As she recounts the final twenty-four hours
onboard, Slade vividly depicts the officers’ anguish and fear as they struggled
to carry out Captain Michael Davidson’s increasingly bizarre commands, which,
they knew, would steer them straight into the eye of the storm. Taking a
hard look at America’s aging merchant marine fleet, Slade also reveals the
truth about modern shipping—a cut-throat industry plagued by razor-thin
profits and ever more violent hurricanes fueled by global warming.

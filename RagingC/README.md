Case study:
failed leadership - **Captain Michael Davidson’s increasingly bizarre commands**

```text
On October 1, 2015, Hurricane Joaquin barreled into the Bermuda Triangle
and swallowed the container ship El Faro whole, resulting in the worst American
shipping disaster in thirty-five years. No one could fathom how a vessel
equipped with satellite communications, a sophisticated navigation system,
and cutting-edge weather forecasting could suddenly vanish—until now.

Relying on hundreds of exclusive interviews with family members and maritime
experts, as well as the words of the crew members themselves—whose conversations
were captured by the ship’s data recorder—journalist Rachel Slade unravels the
mystery of the sinking of El Faro. As she recounts the final twenty-four hours
onboard, Slade vividly depicts the officers’ anguish and fear as they struggled
to carry out Captain Michael Davidson’s increasingly bizarre commands, which,
they knew, would steer them straight into the eye of the storm. Taking a
hard look at America’s aging merchant marine fleet, Slade also reveals the
truth about modern shipping—a cut-throat industry plagued by razor-thin
profits and ever more violent hurricanes fueled by global warming.

## Chapter 01

"Davidson couldn’t afford to screw up with TOTE again. In the cutthroat world of shipping,
prudence didn’t always pay. As a master, you had to be willing to push your luck. He’d lost a
good job once before for playing it too safe when he ordered a tugboat assist after one of his
ships developed steering problems. Davidson decided to take his chances with Joaquin."
```

**"Nothing was more sacred aboard a ship than respecting the chain of command."**

```text
"Though he had as much experience as Davidson, Shultz knew to defer to his captain in all
things to ingratiate himself to his superior. If he thought that sixty miles from the eye
of a major storm didn’t sound right, he kept it to himself. A challenge like that could be
viewed as insubordination."
```
**"Shultz had kids approaching college age. Like everyone else, he had expenses. He needed this job."**

```text
"Jeremie was known for speaking his mind. Unlike the other officers aboard El Faro, he’d come up through
the hawsepipe, meaning he hadn’t graduated from one of the country’s seven maritime academies."
```

**"Instead, he’d signed on to the merchant marine as general crew when he was eighteen years old and worked his way up."**

**"During his downtime aboard the vessel, he’d studied the ship’s books and manuals and often surprised his fellow officers with the depth of his knowledge."**

**"Sailing as a second mate would have meant more money and more authority on the bridge, but for him, it wasn’t worth the stress."**

```text
"Jeremie’s understanding of the weather systems, radar, and loading software—things he’d taught himself—proved invaluable. The team earned one of the highest scores the instructor had ever recorded."
```

**"the remaining crew had to pick up the slack. Setting high standards was tough when the cast of characters was constantly changing."**

```text
"Since arriving in the region in 1492 Columbus had learned about the spiraling storms that came every July through
 October from the Taíno, the native people of Puerto Rico and surrounding islands. The Taíno called these storms
 juracánes—acts of a furious eponymous goddess, which they depicted as a disembodied head adorned with two
 propeller-like wings. She looked remarkably like the hurricane symbol you find on modern maps."
 ```
**"in 1575, writes Stuart Schwartz in his book, Sea of Storms: A History of Hurricanes in the Greater Caribbean from Columbus to Katrina."**

```text
"Due to uncertainty, prudent mariners follow the 3-2-1 rule: Three days ahead of a hurricane’s
forecasted position, stay three hundred miles away; two days ahead, keep out of a two-hundred-mile
radius of its projected center; one day ahead, stay one hundred miles away from its eye in
all directions. The rule is based on the fact that hurricane paths are erratic and unpredictable,
so it’s smart to give the system a wide berth."
```

"The NHC is one of the few government offices that obsessively tracks its own mistakes;
meteorologists use these errors to improve their models and methods. On the NHC website,
there’s an entire section dedicated to its own errors going back to 1970. Multiple line
graphs detail two kinds of errors: track errors and intensity errors. What path the storm
takes depends on the larger forces around it."

"Did he actually need the company’s permission to reroute? His request was carefully worded and thoughtful: “I would like to transit the old Bahama Channel on our return North bound leg to Jacksonville? This route adds approximately 160 nautical miles to the route for a total of 1,261 nautical miles. We need to make around 21 knots for the scheduled 10:05, 10:45 arrival time at Jacksonville pilot station. I have monitored Hurricane Joaquin tracking erratically for the better part of a week. Sometime after 9/30 0200 she began a southwesterly track early this morning. Adjusted our direct normal route in a more southeasterly direction towards"

"That may be true at TOTE, but most ship’s masters I interviewed tell a different story. Although a few can’t believe that a company would pressure anyone to go into a storm, most captains (both foreign and domestic) say that fending off schedulers and managers is simply part of the job. The office worries about customers and profits; captains worry about everything else. Sometimes their interests diverge."

"Regardless, some people, for whatever reason, cave to economic pressures. They assess their risk and decide they’ve got too much to lose if they defy the shipping company. It’s not worth fighting."

"“Project Jennifer” was paid for by the CIA to recover a sunken Soviet submarine lost off the coast of Hawaii. It’s rumored that the sub was sunk when a rogue team of Soviet sailors wrested control and tried to fire a missile at Hawaii, tripping a fail-safe, which caused the missile to explode as it was exiting the torpedo tube."

## Chapter 09

"Davidson was a newcomer, a neophyte, a poor substitute for the profoundly experienced men fifteen years his senior who’d protected her, looked out for her, trained her."
```
**"Shultz hung up the receiver and looked out at the ocean. Maybe he should start worrying about his job instead of the weather."**

```text
"On dawn of October 1, BVS was still showing the hurricane’s eye eighty miles north of its actual location."

"Unfortunately, all of these more nuanced forecasting products were only available to those with internet access. The officers aboard El Faro had no way to browse the web."
```

**"But now that the girls were in college, expenses were high. He had two BMWs in the driveway, tuition bills, taxes. Mastering container ships paid up to $150,000, if you could get the work."**


**"Like many middle-class Americans, Mike couldn’t quite get his head above water."**

"Managing a commercial ship requires serious skills—you’re working with people with a broad range of education

He dug in. He’d sail that ship right into San Juan on Friday morning, just as planned."

"By 1776, America’s vast fleet of merchant and fishing boats, expertly handled by some of the

"the US Merchant Marine suffered more casualties than any other military division in the war."

"it’s cheaper to register ships in countries that have looser regulations, like Liberia and
Panama. Plenty of American-owned ships fly foreign flags to get around Jones Act requirements.
This flight among shippers from America’s registers, called “flags of convenience,” is an
invitation to anarchy, argues William Langewiesche in the Outlaw Sea. By registering a ship
elsewhere, shipowners can avoid US taxes, labor laws, domestic construction requirements,
and anything else that cuts into profitability. And oftentimes ships are registered to
landlocked nations, which underscores the free-for-all nature of this system and the Wild
West nature of the sea."

But knowledge like this takes time to acquire. You have to pay attention, and really care,

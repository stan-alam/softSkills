## notes on Mastering fear
```text
Brandon Webb has run life-threatening missions in the world’s worst trouble spots,
whether that meant jumping out of airplanes, taking down hostile ships on the open
sea, or rolling prisoners in the dead of night in the mountains of Afghanistan.
As a Navy SEAL, he learned how to manage the natural impulse to panic in the f
ace of terrifying situations. As media CEO and national television commentator,
he has learned how to apply those same skills in civilian life.

Drawing on his experiences in combat and business, along with colorful
anecdotes from his vast network of super-achiever friends from astronauts
to billionaires, Webb shows how people from all walks of life can stretch
and transcend their boundaries and learn to use their fears as fuel to achieve
more than they ever thought possible. “Fear can be a set of manacles, holding
you prisoner,” writes Webb. “Or it can be a slingshot, catapulting you on to greatness.”

The key, says Webb, is not to fight fear or try to beat it back, but to embrace
and harness it. In the process, rather than being your adversary, your fear
becomes a secret weapon that allows you to triumph in even the most adverse
situations. In Mastering Fear, Webb and his bestselling coauthor John David
Mann break this transformation down into five practical steps, creating a
must-read manual for anyone looking for greater courage and mastery in their lives.
